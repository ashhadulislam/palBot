What would the ceasefire look like? Below are some of the key points, as communicated by Hamas and by Israeli sources.
As a temporary ceasefire between the Palestinian Resistance in Gaza and Israel appears imminent, there are different understandings of that potential ceasefire as communicated by the Israeli government and the leadership of the Palestinian Resistance.
Top Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya said in a news conference in Beirut on Tuesday evening that Hamas had handed its response to the mediated ceasefire to both Egypt and Qatar. 
Al-Hayya said that the Resistance is now waiting for an Israeli response, although he asserted that Israel has put numerous obstacles before humanitarian ceasefires for at least one month. 
AL-JAZEERA: Sirens were sounding in Greater Tel Aviv, its south, the coast, and central Israel, while the Israeli army announced that its air defenses intercepted 8 missiles.

But what would this ceasefire look like?
Hamas 
According to a Hamas source in Gaza, speaking to RT, the ceasefire would include the following: 
A five-day-ceasefire with the possibility of extension.
Release of all Palestinian women and children from Israeli prisons to the West Bank.
Israel to pull out its invading forces from populated areas in northern Gaza.
Israel to allow for a safe passage between northern and southern Gaza.
The reopening of Rafah crossing to allow for urgent humanitarian assistance.
Israel to cease the use of drones, which have been circulating over Gaza around the clock.
Hamas to release around 50 Israeli prisoners and hostages.
Israel 
Around the same time, the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth (Ynet News) shared its understanding of the potential ceasefire deal. It is as follows:
Palestinians to release 53 Israeli hostages.
A four-day ceasefire. 
A provision that extends the ceasefire by two days if Hamas releases 20 additional captives.
Israel is prepared for a potential extension of the ceasefire beyond six days – contingent on further releases.
Israel commits to refraining from aerial activities over Gaza for six hours every day – to allow Hamas to locate the remaining captives. 
Israel to release 140 to 150 Palestinian prisoners, including women and children. 
Israel would allow the entry of fuel into Gaza and increase humanitarian aid. 
If up to 100 captives are released, Israel will release 300 Palestinian detainees. – Which would, then increase the ceasefire to 10 days.
