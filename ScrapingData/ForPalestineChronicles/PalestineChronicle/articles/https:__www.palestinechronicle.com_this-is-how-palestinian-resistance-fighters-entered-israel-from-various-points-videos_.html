Who would have imagined that the Palestinian Resistance would enter Israel from multiple directions, using various forms of transport, including parachutes? 
More baffling still is that the Palestinian fighters, belonging to the Hamas movement, have managed to capture many Israeli soldiers and force the Israeli military to evacuate several bases in the southern region. 
Videos emerging from Israel and Gaza showed all of this and much more, following a surprise Palestinian attack at Israeli military positions and border settlements on Saturday morning. 
Some videos showed Israeli settlers running in large numbers in the middle of an empty land, somewhere south of Israel.

This is truly unprecedented, not even during the Israeli-Arab wars of the past, where Israel often emerged triumphant, or, at worse, somewhat bruised. 
Images showed cars carrying members of the Palestinian Resistance. Around them are terrified Israelis screaming, while speaking in Hebrew. 
In Ashkelon, video footage documented a huge explosion in front of a building as the fire spread to cars lined up on the street corner.
