On October 23, 2023, Israeli missiles silenced the laughter and joy brought by the young Feadaa al-Laddawi, one of many working in the field of creative emotional support for Gaza’s children.
He was critically injured; his wife and daughter were killed when his apartment in the Nuseirat refugee camp was struck by an Israeli missile.   
Feadaa al-Laddawi also serves as the director of the “Hakawati Entertainment Theater,” a community-based organization that has been providing emotional support through entertainment since 2007.
Additionally, al-Laddawi is the director of “Stars Kids Nursery” in the Nuseirat refugee camp.
On the afternoon of October 23, 2023, Israeli missiles targeted the Al-Salehi 4 tower in the Nuseirat refugee camp, completely destroying an entire floor of the building.
The floor housed four residential apartments, one of which belonged to al-Laddawi. His wife, Rasha, who was a school teacher, and his young daughter, Layan, were killed in the attack. Feadaa and his son Muhammad were critically injured. Several neighbors were also killed in the attack.
Al-Laddawi’s neighbor, Abd al-Rahman Mahmoud, told the Palestine Chronicle of the legacy of Al-Laddawi’s work. He recalled how during the coronavirus outbreak, when families in Gaza were quarantining, Al-Laddawi created a puppet theatre and would perform puppet shows and tell stories to kids in the neighborhood from the window of his home. 
As news of Al-Laddawi’s injuries and the loss of his family spread, grief enveloped the children in the Nuseirat refugee camp. 
Since the beginning of the Israeli war on Gaza on the 7th of October, al-Laddawi followed the developments of the aggression with fear, anticipation, and the hope that it would come to an end.
One of his recent posts on Facebook read: “O Allah, do not let anyone miss their loved ones, O Allah, do not let anyone be scattered, saddened, or lost. We rely on Allah, and He is the best disposer of affairs.”
Al-Laddawi also mourned the death of Menna Allah Saeed Al-Taweel, one of the students at the “Stars Kids Nursery,” who was killed when her home in the Nuseirat refugee camp was targeted by an Israeli airstrike. 
Al-Laddawi’s wife, Rasha, was a teacher in Nuseirat. The mother of one of Rasha’s students, Rima al-Najdi said, “May Allah have mercy on the wife of Feadaa. She is my daughter’s teacher, and I couldn’t bring myself to tell my daughter about her teacher’s martyrdom out of fear for her, as my daughter loves her teacher Rasha very much.”
Thank you for the Smiles
Bassam Hamada was a neighbor and friend of al-Ladawwi. He told The Palestine Chronicle, “Feadaa is an initiative for good and a friend to every child. He has made numerous attempts to spread smiles on the faces of children. However, the occupation attempted to silence the cause of these smiles. We hope for Feadaa’s complete safety and his return to bring smiles to all of us in the near future.”
Mohammad Madi was also a neighbor and friend to al-Ladawwi. He commented on the assassination of the al-Laddawi family, saying,
“We wish for the well-being of our friend Feadaa and his return to his work in helping children and entertaining them. This comes, especially after the significant suffering that children have experienced in this ongoing aggression for the past 19 years. Feadaa, the maker of smiles on our children’s faces, is loved by all children, and they are eagerly awaiting his return.”
Another friend, Naseem Marshoud, said, “A speedy recovery to the dear one who never tired or desisted from bringing smiles to the faces of Gaza’s children. We send you all our well-wishes, my friend.” 
“Rise, Feadaa, for there are many stories that you must tell.”
Karam Samsum, a friend of al-Laddawi, spoke about their recent conversation before his injury. He said,
“Today, Feadaa told me that he’s waiting for a miracle to free him from this painful nightmare. He was exhausted. When I consoled him, telling him that he is our role model in every crisis, I had no idea that he would be the next breaking news.”
Another friend, Ramzi Abu Yousef said, “Rise, Feadaa, to paint joy on the faces of Gaza’s children. They need people like you, your stories, and your hope”.
Al-Laddawi is in the Intensive Care Unit at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.
