Prophet Mohammed was born in Mecca about the year 570, and his birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi’ al-awwal in the Islamic calendar. 
Muslims across the world celebrate the 12th day of Rabi-ul-Awwal, the third month of the Islamic calendar, with the day changing from country to country according to the lunar calendar. 
Prophet Mohammed passed away on the same day as that of his birth at the age of 63.
