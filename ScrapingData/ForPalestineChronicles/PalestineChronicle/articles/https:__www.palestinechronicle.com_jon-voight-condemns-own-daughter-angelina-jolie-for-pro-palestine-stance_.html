Jon Voight has condemned his daughter, Angelina Jolie’s criticism of Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza and her calls for a ceasefire.
In a video, Voight said: “I’m very disappointed that my daughter, like so many, has no understanding of God’s honor. God’s truths.”
“This is about destroying the history of God’s land, the Holy Land. The Land of the Jews. This is justice for God’s children of the Holy Land. The Israeli army must protect thy soil, thy people. This is war. It’s not going to be what the left thinks, it can’t be civil now,” he continued.
“On average, a child is killed and 2 are injured every 10 minutes during the war,” UNRWA said in a statement published on X.https://t.co/uNoOL8Z4H7 pic.twitter.com/mFm6oQGC5a

Refuting claims that innocent Palestinian children are being killed by Israel and ignoring the 17-year-old siege on the Gaza Strip, Voight also said:
“The lie that Israel is killing innocent people, when all have free will to go but they are prisoners of the barbaric country who use them as shields.”
“Israel was attacked…and you fools are calling Israel the problem,” he continued, urging people to ask questions because “the ones who understand truth see the lie.”
In a statement posted on Instagram on November 2, Angelina Jolie said:
“This is the deliberate bombing of a trapped population who have nowhere to flee. Gaza has been an open-air prison for nearly two decades and is fast becoming a mass grave.”
“40% of those killed are innocent children,” Jolie continued, adding:
“Whole families are being murdered. While the world watches and with the active support of many governments, millions of Palestinian civilians – children, women, families – are being collectively punished and dehumanized, all while being deprived food, medicine and humanitarian aid against international law.”
Israel has, thus far, killed over 10,328, including 4,237 children, and wounded nearly 26,000 wounded. Palestinian Ministry of Health reports and international organizations say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.

Despite a massive Israeli military buildup around the Gaza borders and sporadic infiltrations on the outskirts of the besieged Strip, Palestinian Resistance continues to repel Israeli attacks.
To justify its military failure, the Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
