Israeli propaganda, or hasbara, serves an important function, often a violent one. Here are a few Palestinian responses .. 
The effectiveness of Israeli propaganda is not a result of its power, truth, or even savviness, but the near complete absence of voices that are refuting what Israel says and what mainstream media repeat.
For example, Israel claims that Palestinians are beheading babies, creating a massive shock that is being used to dehumanize Palestinians and their resistance. 
This is functional. Following this, Israel intensified its genocidal war against Gaza, killing babies along with their mothers and fathers.

The main difference between Palestinians killing Israeli babies and Israelis killing Palestinian babies, is that the latter is well documented while the former is just a claim and most likely a lie. 
Palestinian activists, intellectuals and journalists are fighting back, however, refuting Israeli propaganda, better yet, explaining why this propaganda is functional in the Israeli war narrative.
Here is a just-released video by the Resistance News Network.
Israeli propaganda is not clever. It simply relies on the deliberate silencing if any voices that don’t support the Israeli narrative. #Gaza #Palestina #GazaFightsForFreedom #Israeli #war #ViralVideo #Viral pic.twitter.com/2VyEh4CXFO
