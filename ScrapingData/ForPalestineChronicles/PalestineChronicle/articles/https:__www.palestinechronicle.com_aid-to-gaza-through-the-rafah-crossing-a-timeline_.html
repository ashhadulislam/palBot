Here are a few important dates regarding the aid that was, or was not allowed, to enter Gaza starting on October 7.
Prior to the Israeli war on Gaza, starting on October 7, the meager aid that arrived to the Strip was estimated at nearly 500 trucks per day. 
That aid was meant to satisfy the needs of 2.3 million Palestinians, most of them living in dire poverty. 
Now imagine that even that meager aid, which hardly allowed Gazans to subsist, was completely cut off on October 7. 
AL-JAZEERA: 11 Palestinians were killed in Rafah. This brings the death toll in the Gaza Strip to 65 since the end of the humanitarian truce and the resumption of the Israeli aggression against Gaza on Friday morning.

This is why the impoverished Strip’s population almost immediately fell from the category of total dependency on aid to that of near starvation, and eventually outright starvation. 
Here are a few important dates regarding the aid that was, or was not allowed, to enter Gaza starting on October 7:
October 7
Gaza is placed under total isolation. 
October 9
Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant decides to cut Gaza off electricity, water, and fuel, in addition to shutting down all crossings that connect Gaza to the outside world. This included the Karem Abu Salem crossing, the main source of food and supplies to the besieged Strip.
October 10
Egyptian Authority declares the shutting down of the Rafah Crossing, following repeated Israeli bombardment of the gates, walls, and surrounding areas of the crossing on the Palestinian side.
October 20
For the first time since the start of the war, Israel allows for the access of 20 trucks, carrying aid to Gaza. This happened as a result of international outrage and was considered to be 3 percent of the average daily requirement of food and supplies that entered Gaza prior to the war. 
ISRAELI CHANNEL 12 (CITING MILITARY SOURCE): The war will continue in the coming days and there is no intention of stopping it.

October 24
Total of aid trucks that entered Gaza since the start of the war did not exceed 62 trucks – compared to the 500 daily trucks that entered prior to the war. 
October 29
United Nations reports say that 33 aid trucks were allowed to enter Gaza. That was described as a drop in a bucket of the required aid.
November 5
UN estimates conclude that 451 trucks have entered Gaza since October 21, which remained nearly 50 trucks below the daily average prior to the war. It is worth mentioning that much of that aid seemed to focus on medical supplies, which only reached parts of southern Gaza, and included thousands of coffins.
November 6
Egyptian authorities allow, for the first time, internationals, Palestinians of dual citizenship, and a small number of Palestinian wounded – 84 – to leave Gaza.
GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY: The number of victims of Israeli aggression since the end of the truce ended on Friday morning has risen to 109.
