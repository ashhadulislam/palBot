Kan described the song as a “song of friendship,” stressing that “its new lyrics express the children of the victorious generation.”
A song entitled “Children of the Generation of Victory” by a group of young Israelis recently went viral on Hebrew social media platforms.
The lyrics of the song urge Israeli soldiers to exterminate everything in Gaza.
Israel’s state broadcaster Kan aired the song under the title “We will annihilate everyone in Gaza,” but was later forced to remove the clip after it sparked angry global responses.
The lyrics of the song “Children of the Generation of Victory” express support for Israeli soldiers and military, and urge children in Israel in particular, and all Jews in general, to destroy Palestinians.
Kan described the song as a “song of friendship,” stressing that “its new lyrics express the children of the victorious generation, and that within a year there will be nothing left there (in reference to the annihilation of everything in Gaza), and these children will return to their homes (the settlements surrounding Gaza), and the world will see how we eliminate our enemy (the Palestinians).”
According to Hebrew media, the new song is an adaptation of the song ‘Evils,’ written by Haim Ghouri. The new version of the song is performed by Israeli children between the ages of 6 and 12.
The new song was produced by Rosenbaum Communications Group, with lyrics written by Ofer Rosenbaum and Shulamit Stolero, who stressed their keenness not to change the choir (a band) from the song “Evils” known in every home in Israel.
The author of the new song, Ofer Rosenbaum, told Hebrew media that,
“The children of the clip are the generation of victory, these children stand strong, proud, love their homeland, and they have only one request, which will not be repeated again: the State of Israel owes security, to them, their families and to all citizens, and we will only achieve this security by achieving a complete victory in Gaza without any concessions.”
One of the children participating in the song, Aden Nezof, 11, from the settlement of Sderot, said, “I know and believe that our soldiers will triumph over the terrorists, my city will return and prosper, and I will be able to return home.”
Lyrics to the Modified Song ‘Evils’
Autumn night falls on the coast of Gaza
Planes bomb destruction .. destruction
Here the Israeli Army crosses the line
To eliminate swastika holders
Another year there will be nothing
And we will return safely to our homeland
In a year, we’ll eliminate them all
Then we go back to plowing our fields.
And we will all remember
The beauty and purity of crystal
Because such evil
He won’t let our hearts forget
Holy love with blood
He’ll come back to bloom among us.
And now the words are over
And our souls would be screaming
Because our soul is not only our homeland
Because our souls today are also fighting
With one nation, with eternity forever
We will not stop and protect our homes
We will not be silent and we will you will never see
How our enemies are being destroyed today
And we will all remember
The beauty and purity of crystal
Because such evil
He won’t let our hearts forget
Holy love with blood
He’ll come back to bloom among us.
The video of the song received harsh criticism and sparked wide controversy.
