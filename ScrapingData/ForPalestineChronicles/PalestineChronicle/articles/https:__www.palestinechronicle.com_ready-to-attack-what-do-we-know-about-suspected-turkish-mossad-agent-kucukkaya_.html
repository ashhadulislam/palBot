Selçuk Küçükkaya was recruited by the notorious Israeli Mossad agency with a specific mission, to spy on Palestinians and others in Türkiye.
In exchange, he received payments in cash, and had to meet with members of the Mossad at least 11 times in ten different European cities.
We know this much and more about Küçükkaya because of revelations made by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT).
Some of the revealed information were also published in Turkish and Israeli newspapers.
Plot Thickens 
Küçükkaya was not the only culprit. 17 others were involved in the operation.
Later we learn that the Mossad had succeeded in forming a spy network in Türkiye in cooperation with “security men” affiliated with Fethullah Gülen, the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported.
Gülen is a sworn enemy of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as he is accused of attempting to oust him through a violent military coup in 2016.
Küçükkaya “was tasked with collecting intelligence and at least on one occasion – as correspondence with his handlers showed – he was to indicate weak spots where action could be taken against a Palestinian who arrived in Istanbul from Lebanon,” Ynet News reported on October 2.
Küçükkaya’s connection to the Mossad was Serkan Özdemirci, a former Turkish military officer.
Özdemirci himself was not arrested, as he had reportedly escaped from the authorities.
From Küçükkaya’s Confessions
“He told me a foreign insurance company was looking for a private investigator. I had a few conversations with him and he introduced me to a man he called Jorge.
“I spoke with Jorge over skype and offered my services and he sent me the names of some restaurants and asked me to look into their businesses. I was asked to provide photos.”
He later met a man he called Alfonso who was Jorge’s superior. “They (The Mossad) gave me a second assignment. I set up a team.”
The second mission, assigned in Rome was orders to “follow Iranian and Lebanese nationals and collect intelligence on an electricity company,” the Israeli newspaper reported.
“Most of the work was following members of foreign companies. When they asked me to investigate Turkish companies, they told me that they were interested in finding out who their owners were,” Küçükkaya reportedly said.
“I received 4,000 euros in cash + expenses. They had a device that looked like a laptop and attached cables to my chest, the tips of my figures and my leg and asked for my name, my profession and if I had worked with the government.”
Another Mission 
“They asked me to work with a money changer in Istanbul and later follow him and identify who he was meeting.”
This time he was paid 6,000 and 7,000 euros, Ynet News reported.
“In 2020, his new mission was to follow a Palestinian by the name of Al Mahmoud who arrived from Beirut. The correspondence with his handlers revealed the alleged methods. He was given flight details and asked to follow the man.”
“These are the details. He (Al Mahmoud is scheduled to arrive from Beirut at 08:50. Prepare a team and note how much luggage he has, does he have security with him? Are his bodyguards armed? Is he traveling by taxi from the airport or is he being picked up by a private vehicle? What is his route into Istanbul?”
Küçükkaya was told to use different cars. “I recommend using three cars and a motorcycle to avoid detection and not risk losing your subject,” an email to Küçükkaya read.
“We will use the surveillance to detect weaknesses so that we could later launch an attack.”
If convicted, the Mossad spies could spend 15 years in prison.
Mossad networks are common in Turkey, and most of their targets are often Palestinians.
