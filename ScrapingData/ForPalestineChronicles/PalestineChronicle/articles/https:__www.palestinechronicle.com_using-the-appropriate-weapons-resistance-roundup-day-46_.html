Resistance in both Gaza and south Lebanon continued, responding to Israeli targeting of civilians with precise attacks against advancing Israeli troops. 
Despite news reports that a temporary ceasefire between Palestinian Resistance and invading Israeli forces in Gaza is imminent, fighting continued throughout northern Gaza and along the Lebanon-Israel border.
Following yesterday’s announcement by Al-Qassam Brigades that it has destroyed, in full or in part, 62 additional Israeli military vehicles in less than three days, Israel carried out several massacres, which reportedly killed and wounded hundreds of Palestinian civilians. 
These are the latest developments on the battlefield according to statements issued by the various Palestinian and Lebanese Resistance groups. 
As a temporary ceasefire between the Palestinian Resistance in Gaza and Israel appears imminent, there are different understandings of that potential ceasefire as communicated by the Israeli government and the leadership of the Palestinian Resistance.https://t.co/srsZgGrsD8 pic.twitter.com/BNevlW4L3u

“At 9:00 p.m. yesterday, Monday, November 20, 2023, our fighters stormed a house in the western part of Al-Zaytoun neighborhood, where (four) soldiers were taking shelter, and they eliminated them at point-blank range.
“Our fighters engaged in intense clashes with a Zionist infantry force this afternoon (Tuesday), inflicting casualties with one killed and another injured in the Beit Hanoun axis.
“(We announce) the death of the settler Hanna Katsir, whom we had previously expressed our readiness to release for humanitarian reasons. However, the enemy’s procrastination has led to the loss of her life. In light of this announcement, we reaffirm our disclaimer of responsibility for our captives of war amidst the barbaric and savage bombardment on every inch of the Gaza Strip.”
