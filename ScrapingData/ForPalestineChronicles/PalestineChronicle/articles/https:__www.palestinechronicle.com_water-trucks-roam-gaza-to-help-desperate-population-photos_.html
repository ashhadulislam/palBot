The Palestine Chronicle joined workers with the water department in the central Gaza region as they tried to repair water pipes.
There is no running water in Gaza. 
On October 9, Israeli Defense Minister Gallant announced in a video statement a “total” blockade of the already besieged Gaza Strip.
“We are putting a complete siege on Gaza … No electricity, no food, no water, no gas – it’s all closed,” Gallant said.
The remaining water comes from wells, unfiltered and polluted. 
Electricity outages and depleting fuel sources are complicating Gaza’s access to its water.
