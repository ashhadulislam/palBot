A man, whose identity and nationality are yet to be confirmed, assaulted a group of UNICEF aid workers who were fundraising for Palestine in Italy. 
UNICEF workers were collecting donations for the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the war-torn Gaza Strip when an angry man approached them.

He was caught on camera yelling at the workers while saying that he would ‘’kill’ them if they said the word ‘Palestine’.
The workers tried to calm him down, repeatedly: “Stop it, stop it, we are talking about peace.”
The man, however, looked furious as he kept physically threatening them and yelling:
“Say Palestine, say Palestine one more time and I will kill you.” 
According to Italian trade unionist Giorgio Cremaschi, the incident took place in the northern Italian city of Milan.
