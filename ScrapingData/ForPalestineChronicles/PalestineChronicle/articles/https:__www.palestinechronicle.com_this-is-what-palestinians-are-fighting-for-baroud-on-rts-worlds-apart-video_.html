In an interview with the popular Russia Today TV show ‘Worlds Apart’, Palestinian journalist and editor of The Palestine Chronicle, Dr. Ramzy Baroud, discussed the modern Palestinian struggle and the persistence of the Palestinian Resistance.
“For Palestinians, Palestine was on its way to becoming a nation-state in the modern sense, but there was a disruption that has happened, particularly when Britain in 1917, with the Balfour Declaration, granted Palestine to the Zionist movement, creating a disruption to the historic cycle,” Baroud said.
“The modern Palestinian state and the modern Palestinian struggle is really, essentially a political struggle, not a religious struggle that aims at correcting that course of history.”
Baroud added that “Israelis live in total isolation,”, highlighting how they actually internalized the perception that the Hamas attack on October 7 was, indeed “unprovoked”.
“They don’t believe that military occupation, apartheid, sieges, massacres, killings, violence had anything to do with that.”
Baroud also spoke about the necessity to grant justice to the Palestinian people before speaking about solutions. “Israelis do not want any kind of solution to their ultimate goal (which is the complete control over historic Palestine”.
In reference to the relation between political struggle and religion, Baroud explained:
“Groups like Hezbollah or Hamas are non-state actors but they operate within national boundaries. They don’t have a jihadist mission to liberate Spain or bring Spain back to the rule of the Islamic kingdom of Al-Andalus or restore the Caliphate. Unless you understand that, you can easily fall into the US propaganda, that Taliban is Hamas, Hamas is ISIS, ISIS is Al-Qaeda and so forth.”
Baroud continued that those who use such language “don’t allow for a serious and honest conversation in mainstream media” about the Resistance in Palestine or Lebanon.
