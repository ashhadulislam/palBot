The bombing of a school, also used as a makeshift UN shelter for Gaza’s refugees, represented one of the lowest points of the Israeli war on the Strip. 
At least 15 displaced Palestinian refugees were killed and many others wounded on Saturday, November 4,  when Israel bombed Al-Fakhoura school in the refugee camp of Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip. 
The Al-Fakhura massacre was not the only Israeli massacre of civilians on that day, as several hospitals and other civilian infrastructure were also bombed. 
But the bombing of a school, also used as a makeshift UN shelter for Gaza’s refugees, represented one of the lowest points of the Israeli war on the Strip. 
Independent journalist Anas al-Sharif visited the school and recorded some of the aftermath of the Israeli attack: kids coloring books, half-prepared bread, and so much innocent blood.
