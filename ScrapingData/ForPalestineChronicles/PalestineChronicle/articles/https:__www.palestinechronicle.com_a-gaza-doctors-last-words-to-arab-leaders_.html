This is the last social media post written by Dr. Basel Mahdi, in the form of a Facebook post, hours before he was killed in the Mahdi maternity clinic on Saturday.
Dr. Mahdi wrote this post regarding the failure of Arab and Muslim leaders, meeting in Riyadh on Saturday, to take any meaningful action to end the Israeli war and siege on Gaza.
“No one is going to die short (of the life allocated to him by God). But some people will die short of dignity, short of humanity, and short of principles. 
“Shame on you, and shame on your (false sense of) Arabism. 
“May Allah disown you, may Allah never forgive you.”
On the same day of Dr. Mahdi’s killing, an extraordinary joint summit of the League of Arab States (LAS) and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) was held in Riyadh.
The participants agreed that it is necessary to stop Israel’s military operations as soon as possible, without reaching any significant outcome.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,360 Palestinians, including 4,609 children and 3,100 women. The number of wounded has reached 28,200.

The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
