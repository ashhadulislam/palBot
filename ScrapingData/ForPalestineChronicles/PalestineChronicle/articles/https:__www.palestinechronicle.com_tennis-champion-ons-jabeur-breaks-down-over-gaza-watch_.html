When the journalist tried to change the subject, telling her that “these are moments (..)  where we can focus on sports” and stay “away from the problems for a few minutes,” Jabeur insisted:
“It’s very tough seeing children and babies dying every day. It’s.. it’s heartbreaking, so, I have decided to donate part of my prize money to help the Palestinians.”
“I cannot be happy with just this win. I am sorry guys, it’s supposed to be about tennis but it is very frustrating looking at the news every day, so, I am sorry, it is not a political message here, it’s just humanity, that’s it. I want peace in this world, that’s it,” Jabeur concluded.
