More voices are joining the global solidarity movement demanding an end to the Israeli war on the besieged Gaza Strip. 
While Ronaldo is yet to speak out against the recent devastating Israeli bombing of Gaza, his partner, Spanish model and influencer Georgina Rodriguez, took to her Instagram stories to express solidarity with Palestinian children. 
Rodriguez shared a picture of children on both Palestinian and Israeli sides. 
One of the pictures included a Palestinian girl holding a stuffed animal while standing on the rubble of her home, destroyed by an Israeli airstrike. 
Rodriguez put a peace emoji next to the pictures. 
While it appears she took a ‘balanced’ stance in this instance, Rodriguez has already spoken out in solidarity with Palestinians in the past. 
On May 9, 2021, during one of Israel’s wars in the impoverished and besieged Gaza Strip, Rodriguez shared a post on Facebook reading ‘Pray for Palestine’, adorned with a Palestinian flag.
Dave Chapelle
During a recent live show in Boston, iconic African-American comedian Dave Chapelle shared his thoughts on Israel’s war on Gaza and how it made him feel as an American citizen. 
Chapelle criticized both Israel, its devastating bombing campaign of Gaza, as well as the US government, Israel’s largest financial, political and military supporter. 
While the show was not recorded, those who were in the audience said that Chapelle weighed in on how ridiculous it was that people are losing their jobs for supporting Palestinians. 
Someone in the audience reportedly told him to ‘shut up’, and Chapelle replied by criticizing Israel’s killing of civilians and blocking of food, water, and humanitarian aid. 
The comedian reportedly spoke on how ludicrous it was that his tax dollars were being used to kill Palestinian civilians.
Dave Chappelle decried the humanitarian crisis unfolding at the Gaza Strip in comments at a show in Boston last week, drawing cheers from some audience members and causing others to walk out, according to news reports and a spokeswoman for the comedian. https://t.co/daJ3cRcb4C

Some of the audience walked out while others applauded for his solidarity with the Palestinian cause. 
A large number of artists, athletes and other public figures have already spoken out against the war, either directly declaring their solidarity with Gaza, or calling for an immediate ceasefire. 
The Israeli war has thus far killed over 7,000 Palestinains, of which nearly 3,000 are children. Over 18,000 are wounded.
