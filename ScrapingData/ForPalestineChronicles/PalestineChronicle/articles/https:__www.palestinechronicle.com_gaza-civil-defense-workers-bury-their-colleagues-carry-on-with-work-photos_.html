Israel continues to target Palestinian civil defense teams as they desperately try to save the lives of as many Gaza victims as possible.
Seven civil defense workers have been killed so far and many others are wounded as Israeli warplanes struck the headquarters of the Civil Defense in Gaza City on Monday morning.
Yet, they quickly bury their fallen colleagues and carry on with their work.
