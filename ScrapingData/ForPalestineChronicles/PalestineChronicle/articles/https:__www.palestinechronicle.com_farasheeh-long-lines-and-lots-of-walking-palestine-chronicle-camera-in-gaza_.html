From Al-Bureij refugee camp to Nuseirat to Deir Al-Balah, everywhere you look in Gaza, there is nothing but destruction. 
Long lines for the meager amounts of food that arrive here, and a seemingly endless odyssey of refugees looking for clean water.
Families walk back and forth looking for something, for someone, or for a moment of sanity in a relentless Kafkaesque chaos. 
There are also the markets, where people sell whatever little items they sold before the war, sometimes their own clothes, to buy food. 
And of course, there is Hajj Farida.
Hajj Farida was originally from Beit Lahia. She had fled her small town in northern Gaza and is currently in Nuseirat, in central Gaza. 
We caught up with her as she sold traditional home bread, called Farasheeh. Though she has no tools aside from her hands and an open fire, somehow her Farasheeh comes out in perfect shape. 
She told us, as she sat on hard ground, this was the only way she could feed her family, who are currently in a shelter in a UN school.
