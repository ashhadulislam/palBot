“We recall our repeated warnings of the dangers of the situation exploding as a result of the continued occupation,” the statement added.
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan spoke with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to discuss the escalation of the violence in and around Gaza, according to the statement.
