Another star who recently took to social media to weigh in on the bombardment of Gaza is Seattle-based American rapper and artist Macklemore.
The two-time Grammy winner, who has had multiple songs on the Billboard #1, expressed his sympathy for Gaza, which has been undergoing heavy Israeli bombardment that, so far, killed over 4,100 Palestinians:
“I stand for peace. I stand for love. I stand for freedom. And because of that, I stand for a Free Palestine and an end to the looming genocide of its people.”
While expressing sympathy towards “Israelis who lost loved ones,” Macklemore said that “killing innocent civilians in retaliation as a collective punishment is not the answer.”
The renowned artist also highlighted double standards. “We are collectively praying for Israel,” he said, wondering:
“But why are we not doing the same for Palestinians? How are one group of people’s lives worth more than others?”
“We are witnessing an unfolding genocide in Palestine at this very moment,” Macklemore also said, adding that this is a “US backed human catastrophe in front of our eyes.”
On October 7, Israel launched its latest military aggression on the besieged and impoverished Gaza Strip. The number of Palestinians killed and wounded in the Israeli war on Gaza rose to over 4,100 dead and over 13,500 wounded.
On October 9, Israel imposed a “total siege” on the Gaza Strip, blocking the entry of food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity.
