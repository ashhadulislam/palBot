Our correspondent sent us these photos illustrating the everyday reality in the besieged Strip just hours before the resumption of Israeli airstrikes.
Though some supplies have reportedly been allowed to the Gaza Strip as a result of a seven-day temporary truce between the Israeli army and the Palestinian Resistance, the situation in Gaza remains a desperate one. 
Palestine Chronicle correspondent in central Gaza, Abdallah Aljamal, sent us these photos illustrating the everyday reality in the besieged Strip just hours before the resuming of Israeli airstrikes.
Some of the photos show Palestinian municipality workers in the Nuseirat refugee camp, desperately attempting to reconnect water lines that were bombed by Israel. 
Others show families trying to protect themselves from the rain or cooking on open fire in street corners.
