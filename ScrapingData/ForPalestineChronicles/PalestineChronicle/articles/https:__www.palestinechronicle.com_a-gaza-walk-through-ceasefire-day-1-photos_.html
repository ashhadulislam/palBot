Palestine Chronicle correspondent in Gaza, Abdallah Aljamal, traveled in Gaza immediately following the start of a four-day ceasefire between Palestinian Resistance and Israel. 
He assessed some of the damage created by 48 days of relentless Israeli bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, watching people as they hastily tried to reclaim a degree of normalcy amid the mass destruction created by the Israeli military machine. 
Some of the photos below were supplied through Mohamoud Abu Hamda and other local photojournalists.
