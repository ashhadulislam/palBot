Tuesday evening, Israeli planes bombed one of the two bakeries in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing three workers.
The Nuseirat refugee camp is one of the largest, if not the largest in size in the whole Gaza Strip. 
It is a home to over 100,000 people. 
Following the start of the Israeli war, an additional 100,000 people, mostly coming from northern Gaza, are estimated to have fled to the crowded camp.
This meant that the food supplies, already shrinking in Nuseirat, would have to feed at least twice as many people. 
As food began running low, the two bakeries in the camp became the only source of bread for over 200,000 people. 
But Tuesday evening, Israeli planes bombed one of the two bakeries, killing three workers.
Palestine Chronicle correspondent in the central Gaza Strip reported that the workers were preparing the dough for the following day.
He believes that the bakery was attacked by Israel to worsen an already horrific humanitarian crisis, thus pushing Palestinians to surrender. 
Nuseirat has received a large share of Israeli bombs since the start of the war. Though no precise numbers can be provided at this time, it is estimated that hundreds of the camp’s residents were killed and wounded in Israeli strikes.
