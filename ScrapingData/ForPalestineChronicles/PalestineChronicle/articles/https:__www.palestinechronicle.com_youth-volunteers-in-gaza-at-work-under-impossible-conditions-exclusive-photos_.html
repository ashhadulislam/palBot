The Palestine Chronicle joined volunteers as they distributed meals to refugees at UN facilities in the Nuseirat refugee camp.  
In Gaza, despite a horrific war, thousands of young men and women formed committees to help struggling civil defense workers care for nearly a million internally displaced refugees. 
Our correspondent in the central Gaza Strip joined some of these volunteers as they distributed meals to stranded refugees at United Nations facilities in the Nuseirat refugee camp.  
In the gallery below, young people are seen at work inside a UNRWA school, and while joining civil defense workers and medical staff as they desperately try to help the wounded and bury the dead.
