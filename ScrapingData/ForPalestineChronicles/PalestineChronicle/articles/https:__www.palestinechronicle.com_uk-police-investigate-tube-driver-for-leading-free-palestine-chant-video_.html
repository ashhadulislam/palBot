British Transport Police (BTP) and Transport for London (TfL) are investigating a Tube driver for leading a “Free, free Palestine” chant on a London Underground train on Saturday.
According to BBC News, a video circulated online, appeared to show a Central line driver using the public announcement system to lead the “free Palestine” chant, as carriages of passengers were en-route to a pro-Palestinian march in the city.

The passengers can be heard responding to the announcement, in which the driver can be heard saying “Hope you all have a pleasant day today” and “Keep all those people in your prayers”.
BTP Assistant Chief Constable Sean O’Callaghan said the force was “aware of footage circulating on social media which suggests chants are led by the driver of a train in London earlier”.
“BTP are working with Transport for London and investigating the matter.”
Hundreds of thousands of people joined a pro-Palestinian demonstration in central London on Saturday, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
Chanting “Free Palestine”, holding banners and waving Palestinian flags, the protesters moved toward Downing Street, the official residence and office of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
