Among the various types of weapons and munitions, Israel relies on improvised rockets in its deadly war on Gaza.
Military and strategic expert Fayez al-Duwairi said that munitions with which Israel bombs the Gaza Strip are old rockets that have been modified to become guided, smart missiles to cause large scale destruction.
In an interview with Aljazeera Arabic Channels, al-Duwairi explained that US-supplied F-15 fighter jets carry this type of rockets, which are old missiles bearing the name “MK”, namely: “MK-80”, “MK-82”, “MK-83”, “MK-84”.
He pointed out that the US military have converted these rockets into smart missiles after providing them with GPS systems.
Al-Duwairi noted that the weight of explosives with “MK-84” missiles is estimated at half a ton and their impact reaches 365 meters.
Intentional Destruction
The military expert said that since these bombs are considered ‘smart’, it follows that the massive destruction they create is intentional. “There is a systematic destruction process,” al-Duwairi said.
He explained that these missiles are supposed to use three types of fuses after modification: The “shock fuse”, which explodes on impact, the “delay fuse”, which is used to penetrate deep in the ground, and the “timing fuse”.
Al-Duwairi said it is likely that the massacre resulting from the Israeli attack on Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza – which killed more than 470 martyrs – was carried out using an MK-84 missile equipped with a time fuse that exploded at a certain height above the ground.
