Photos below provide glimpses from the Gaza inferno, a nightmare shared by 2.3 million people in Gaza. 
On Friday, November 3, following a tortuous journey, thousands of Gaza workers were transported back to Gaza.
They exchanged the torment of Israel and the occupied West Bank with arriving in a war zone in Gaza, or rather a genocide.
Meanwhile, Israeli bombs continue to be dropped in unprecedented randomness over Palestinian civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip.

Photos below, some taken by independent photographer Anas al-Sharif, and others by the Palestine Chronicle, provide glimpses from the Gaza inferno, a nightmare shared by 2.3 million people in Gaza.
