There is no room in hospitals in the besieged Gaza Strip and Israeli airstrikes have left Gaza’s health system “on the verge of collapse”, according to the World Health Organization.
Meanwhile, at least 10 paramedics have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its latest military operation on the besieged Strip, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society.
WHO: On the Verge of Collapse
Due to the Israeli decision to cut off fuel, electricity, and water, Gaza’s hospitals now only have a few hours of electricity a day.
Therefore, WHO has called for an immediate end to hostilities and the protection of healthcare facilities.

“We call for the immediate opening of a humanitarian corridor to ensure that there are no obstacles to the entry of health and humanitarian supplies.”

In a separate statement on Friday, the Red Cross called for the protection of “Gaza’s civilians and infrastructure,” adding:
