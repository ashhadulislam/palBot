If you look anywhere in Gaza, and we mean anywhere, you will find destruction, tragedy, and the lack of everything. But there is something that Palestinians still possess.
The Palestine Chronicle has lost touch with its correspondents in northern Gaza. We are desperate for any information on them and we will keep you updated. 
But our correspondents in the central and southern Gaza Strip are still active, despite everything.
Our reporter in the Nuseirat refugee camp told us that Israeli missiles are now bombing markets and even falafel and hummus joints as if the attempt is to target whatever remains of Palestinian food supplies.
The population of Nuseirat has doubled in recent days as nearly 100,000 displaced refugees from the north have escaped to other parts of Gaza seeking shelters. 
But a particular photo has struck us. That of a Palestinian boy, standing close to his younger brother, with a defiant smile on his face and a victory sign. 
The gallery below is a mix of photos from throughout the Gaza Strip, on the 15th day of the Israeli bombardment. They are mostly from Nuseirat, but others are also from Khan Yunis – a dilapidated market, rescue efforts in a destroyed neighborhood and a hospital emergency room.
