Desperately trying to get ahold of his family in the Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza, Palestine Chronicle editor Ramzy Baroud received this message from a young relative. 
W.I.B. was conveying a message from her father, Ramzy’s cousin, who is currently trapped with his family at the Shifa Hospital in Gaza.
Over the course of the war, this family has lost many of its members, between dead, wounded, and missing. 
There is no safe space in Gaza.
At least 10 members of the Najjar family were killed after Israel bombed a residential neighborhood in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.

This is her message: 
“Assalamu alaikum, how are you, uncle? What’s your news? Please reassure us that you are good. How is the family? God willing, they are okay.
“Uncle, I just spoke with my father and thanks to God, everything is okay. 
“He sends his regards. I told him that Uncle Abu Sami was trying to get ahold of him. He is trying to reach you in any possible way, and he sends his salaams to you as well.
“My father sends you his regards and reassures you that everyone is okay, and they just want your prayers. 
“They are still under siege in the Shifa Hospital, with my injured mother. 
“Inshallah, everything is going to be okay. 
“The rest of the family is divided in too many places. My youngest brother Abed and his family are being used as human shields by the Israeli soldiers. Inshallah, everything is going to be okay. 
“And my sister Somaya is sheltering at the UNDP building. Yesterday, they were hit by an Israeli shell. 
“All three sons of my aunt were killed. 60 others were wounded. They are all bleeding, and the ambulance cannot reach them. They are still under siege.
“All thanks to Allah. God willing, this hardship will be over.

“Thank you, uncle. We wish safety for everyone. 
“May Allah bless the souls of the martyrs and heal the wounded.
“I just wanted to reassure you and convey my father’s regards.”
