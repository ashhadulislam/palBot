Gazans are left with no other option but to dig mass graves, and some bulldozers are forced to leave the destruction sites and dig wherever a space in the overcrowded Strip is found.
Gaza is out of bulldozers.
Whatever equipment the besieged Gaza Strip had are being fully utilized in removing wreckage of destroyed homes and residential towers, atop their thousands of families across the Strip.
Much of the digging for survivors has been taking place by hand.
But now that Gazans are left with no other option but to dig mass graves, some bulldozers are forced to leave the destruction sites and dig wherever a space in the overcrowded Strip is found.
Yousef Al-Khatib stood at the site of a mass grave as it was being dug by the civil defense in Gaza.
He was also there when the bodies arrived.
The tragedy cannot be described by words, he says.
