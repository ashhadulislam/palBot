With very little equipment, fuel and food, Gaza’s civil defense continues to defy odds in keeping hundreds of thousands of people alive, despite an ongoing Israeli genocide. 
In the gallery below, the few working Palestinian bulldozers, many civil defense workers and numerous volunteers remove rubble and debris from destroyed Palestinian buildings in central Gaza.
Others try to repair broken water pipes, also damaged during Israeli strikes.
A state of starvation is experienced by most Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, with little food and water remaining anywhere in Gaza.
