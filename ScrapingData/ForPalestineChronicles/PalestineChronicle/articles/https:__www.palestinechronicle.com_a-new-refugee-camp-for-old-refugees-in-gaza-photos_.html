As hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled their homes in Gaza, UNRWA established new Palestinian refugee camps. 
Where do refugees go after spending 75 years living as refugees? 
The agony of Gaza continues, taking on yet deeper and more surreal meanings.
As hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled their homes in Gaza, they were met by Israeli bombs, even on their journey to escape south.
Now that southern Gaza has doubled in population – new refugees living with old refugees – the United Nations Agency for Palestinian Refugees, UNRWA has resumed an old habit: establishing new Palestinian refugee camps. 
It is as if 75 years have not passed since the Nakba. Similar tents, barefoot children, hungry and frightened civilians, and an endless story of human suffering.
The Palestine Chronicle visited one of these new refugee camps in the Khan Younis area, in the southern Gaza Strip.
