Palestinian clergy from the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs held a rally today in solidarity with Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque. 
The holy shrines of Jerusalem, especially Al-Aqsa have been under growing Israeli attacks. 
The raids by extremist Israeli Jewish settlers are organized under the protection of the Israeli police. Their frequency has increased by manyfold during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
The protest was organized by the Jerusalem Unit of the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs, in partnership with the institutions working for Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa throughout the Gaza Strip.
The Undersecretary of the ministry, Dr. Abdul Hadi Al-Agha, said in a press conference in Gaza City that it was important to bring together scholars and institutions working for Jerusalem, in light of the recent escalations of ferocious attacks by illegal Jewish settlers. 
“We cannot allow settlers to continue attacking Al-Aqsa Mosque and the women who are there to protect it,” Al-Agha also said.
He called on Arab and Islamic countries to “protect Al-Aqsa Mosque and its people from these ongoing crimes.”
