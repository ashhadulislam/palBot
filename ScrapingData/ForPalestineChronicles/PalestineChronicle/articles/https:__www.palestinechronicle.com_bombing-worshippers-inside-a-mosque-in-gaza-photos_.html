The Palestine Chronicle visited the site of the ‘Martyrs of Nuseirat Mosque’ in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. 
Nuseirat mosque was bombed and destroyed by Israeli warplanes in recent days, resulting in many injuries and significant damage. 
Many people were sheltering inside the mosque during the Israeli strike, which took place on Wednesday afternoon. 
The wounded have all been taken to Al-Aqsa Hospital for treatment, according to our correspondent. 
It is uncertain if any of the worshippers taking shelter in the mosque have survived. 
Many mosques have been targeted, fully destroyed or damaged in the Israeli war on the Strip.
According to UN data, hundreds of residential buildings have already been destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. More than 1 million Palestinians have been displaced.
