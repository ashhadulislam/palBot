The Israeli PM went on to describe the alleged crimes perpetrated by Hamas and condemned the “sickening display of celebration and glorification of evil”.
“President Biden was absolutely correct in calling this sheer evil,” he said.
“Hamas is ISIS,” Netanyahu added, “and just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed.”
“Thank you for being here today, thank you America, for standing with Israel, today, tomorrow and always,” Netanyahu concluded.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it’s a time for “moral clarity” and thanks Secretary of State Blinken for being in Israel.

For his part, Blinken expressed his solidarity, saying:
“I come before you not only as the United States, but also as a Jew. My grandfather fled pogroms in Russia.”
“I understand the harrowing echoes that Hamas’ massacres carry for Israeli Jews and for Jews everywhere,” he said.
Blinken also echoed Netanyahu’s comparison to ISIS, by saying:
“”Hamas’s countless acts of terror (…) brings to mind the worst of ISIS.”
