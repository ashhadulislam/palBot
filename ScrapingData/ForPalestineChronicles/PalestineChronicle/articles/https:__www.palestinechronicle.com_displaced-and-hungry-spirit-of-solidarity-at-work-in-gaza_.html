The Palestine Chronicle spoke to displaced Palestinians and to residents of the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, who warmly welcomed them.
Τhousands of Palestinians are leaving the Gaza Strip’s north as Israel ramps up its military offensive while food and water supplies are dwindling.
More than 70 percent of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have already been displaced and the humanitarian situation is dire.
The Palestine Chronicle spoke to displaced Palestinians coming from the north and to residents of the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, who warmly welcomed them.
Displaced Palestinians from the North
“People who have evacuated from the north are now sleeping in the streets of Nuseirat, due to the overcrowding of schools and shelters,” said media activist Zakaria al-Qatraoui, describing the conditions of Palestinians displaced from Gaza and the north to the central and southern provinces of the Gaza Strip.
“The situation of the displaced in the streets is very difficult. They sleep in the open air on the ground, with no place to go,” Al-Qatraoui added. 
“They are stranded, and the shelters are crowded with poor services. May God help them, and the Relief Agency must fulfill its role towards all the residents of the Strip, especially the displaced among them.”
Bringing Tears to Stone 
Maysa Aql, a resident of Nuseirat refugee camp said, “I have seen dozens of families lying on the ground in the Nuseirat camp. Their conditions are extremely difficult, and their plight brings tears to stone. 
“They left their homes to escape the bombing, only to find the shelters full. The market in Nuseirat and most areas of the camp have been bombed, with destruction and bombing everywhere.”
Aya Ziad added, “In the face of these difficult conditions, people should support each other. The situation of the displaced is sad, and their living conditions are very poor. International institutions must assume their responsibilities, especially UNRWA.”
Rami Al-Bashty invited the displaced to come to Khan Yunis, saying, 
“The situation in Khan Yunis is the same as in the Nuseirat camp and all areas in the central and southern Gaza Strip. All of them are filled with displaced people, but our homes are open to all of them. In these conditions, goodness should increase among us.”
No One is a Stranger
Ismaeel Al-Faqi, who is a resident of Nuseirat, declared, “I doubt that anyone who enters the Nuseirat camp will feel like a stranger.
“The people of Nuseirat serve everyone with love. It is their duty to serve the displaced, show solidarity with them, and share bread, food, and drink with them. They are our people, and we are one with them,” he added.
Mariam Mohammed, whose family fled from the northern areas of Gaza to Nuseirat, praised the residents, saying, “I was displaced with my family to the Nuseirat camp due to the bombing in the northern Gaza Strip, and the people of Nuseirat welcomed us with the most beautiful reception. We don’t feel far from our homes.”
Khalil Ayyash was also forced to flee his home in northern Gaza. “I am a displaced person from the north, currently residing in the Nuseirat camp,” he said. 
“Indeed, the people of Nuseirat welcomed us and respected us greatly. This reflects the nobility of their morals and their good treatment. May God bless all the people of Nuseirat.”
We Will Rebuild 
Ahlam Abu Zeina told The Palestine Chronicle, “All the residents of Gaza must come together in these difficult circumstances. The people of Gaza are standing strong for each other, and truly, Nuseirat is one of the most beautiful places, and its people have taken on the responsibility of welcoming the displaced.”
Khaled Abu Ureiban, who now calls Nuseirat home, commented, “Since the first moment the displaced arrived at the Nuseirat camp, we have shared everything with them. But the living conditions are extremely difficult.”
“The displaced, the people of Nuseirat, and the people of Gaza all face the danger of famine. There is no electricity, no water, and no food. Diseases have started spreading,” Abu Ureiban added. 
“While we show solidarity together, the aggression must stop. Life must return to Gaza, and all the displaced must return to their homes. We will succeed in rebuilding everything that the occupation destroyed and restore Gaza to its beautiful state.”
The Ministry of Interior in the Gaza Strip announced that more than a million citizens have been displaced to the central and southern governorates of the Gaza Strip. 
The difficult living conditions persist amid the ongoing Israeli war on Gaza for the 36th consecutive day.
