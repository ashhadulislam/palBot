Occupied Palestine woke up Saturday morning to the news of a major military campaign launched by the Palestinian Resistance, targeting various Israeli cities and settlements.
Sources in the Resistance say that the well-coordinated attack is a response to the Israeli army and settlersâ€™ violence in the West Bank and the killing of a large number of children.
