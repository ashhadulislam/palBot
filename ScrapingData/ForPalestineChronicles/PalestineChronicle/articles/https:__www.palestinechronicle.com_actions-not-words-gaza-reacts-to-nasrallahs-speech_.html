The Palestine Chronicle asked people in Gaza, mostly displaced refugees in the central part of the Strip, about their views of Nasrallah’s speech. 
In a much-anticipated speech on Friday, Hezbollah Secretary-General, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, confirmed that the Al-Aqsa Flood operation “has expanded to include more than one front and battleground.”
During the ceremony in honor of the fighters killed in the recent escalation with Israel, Nasrallah said that the Palestinian operation on October 7 further exposed the weakness and vulnerability of Israel, which is “weaker than a spider’s web.”
Nasrallah also highlighted the hardships Palestinians had to endure before October 7, saying that “the circumstances in the last (few) years in Palestine were very tough, especially with Benjamin Netanyahu’s fascist, idiotic, stupid, and monstrous (government).”

He also reiterated that “the unfolding events in Al-Aqsa Flood are clear proof that Iran does not have any mandate at all over the Resistance factions,” and that “the real decision-makers are the leaders of the (Palestinian) Resistance and its freedom fighters.”
The Palestine Chronicle asked people in Gaza, mostly displaced refugees in the central part of the Strip, their views of Nasrallah’s speech. 
Here is what they said.  
Support for the Resistance
Muhammad Hamad:
“What’s beautiful about Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s speech is his support for the Resistance factions in Gaza, and his emphasis on continuing the fight alongside the people of Gaza to stop the (Israeli) aggression, break the siege, and ensure that our holy places are not violated.”
Only Actions Matter
Ayman al-Hafi:
“Some people are focusing on analyzing the rhetoric of the speech and its message, but for the people of Gaza, only actions matter and benefit them.”
A Waste of Time
Osman Matar:
“I wasted an hour and a half of my life listening to words that didn’t offer anything real to Gaza.”
We Die Every Day
Hassan Al-Qatrway: 
“In Gaza, deaths are counted by the days of war. Whoever dies on the first day dies once, and whoever dies on the second day dies twice. Those who live to see the 28th day, die many times.”
Less Words, More Actions
Ali Jouda:
“Gaza is waiting for actions more than words. I was surprised by Nasrallah’s speech, which merely described the situation. I expected it to contain important announcements, but I was greatly surprised.”
No Substance
Mohammed Al-Hour:
“It came to explain things we already know and understand. Unfortunately, it’s a speech without any real relevance.”
A Daring Speech
Wissam Ali:
“It’s an excellent speech, and no Arab leader would dare to speak as Nasrallah did. We thank him, and we look forward to more.”
Gaza is Strong
Naji Salim:
“Gaza takes care of its own affairs, and it knows best about everything that’s happening.”
Miscalculations
Hayder al-Musdar:
“Many are analyzing Hezbollah’s calculations regarding the destruction Lebanon will face (in case of an all out war), but few are discussing the catastrophe, chaos, and strategic havoc that Israel will experience.” 
Since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza, on October 7, the Lebanese Resistance movement Hezbollah has engaged directly, but relatively in a limited way in the war against the Israeli occupation.
According to Hezbollah sources, the movement has killed, as of November 1, at least 120 soldiers, and wounded many more, while targeting numerous military bases, intelligence installations, and other Israeli positions across the Lebanon-Israel border.

Israel has occupied parts of Lebanon for decades and has only left the country in 2000, following stiff Lebanese resistance under Hezbollah’s leadership. 
It attempted to re-occupy Lebanon in 2006 but failed in what Lebanon considers a major victory against Israel. 
Israel, however, continues to occupy parts of Lebanon, namely the Sheeba Farms region.
Hezbollah has vowed to recover every inch of Lebanon that has been occupied by Israel contrary to international law.
