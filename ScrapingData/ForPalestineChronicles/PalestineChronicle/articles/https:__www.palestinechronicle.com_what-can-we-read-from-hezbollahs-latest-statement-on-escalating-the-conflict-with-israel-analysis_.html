Deputy Secretary General of the Lebanese Resistance group Hezbollah, Sheikh Naim Qassem, issued an important statement today, October 21. 
The statement, a copy of which was received by The Palestine Chronicle, once more emphasized complete solidarity between Hezbollah and Palestinian Resistance groups in Gaza. 
However, the statement carried political and strategic messages regarding Hezbollah’s next move in its ongoing, although limited confrontation with the Israeli military in south Lebanon. 
‘Victory for the Resistance’
“Hezbollah is committed to keeping pace and confronting as part of its vision to serve the victory of resistance, the liberation of Palestine and al-Quds, and what serves our nation.”
The phrase “keeping pace” here is quite critical. It simply means that Hezbollah will escalate depending on the escalation of the Israeli war on Gaza.

‘We Will Do More’
“What we are doing in the south (of Lebanon) now is a stage that aligns with the confrontation. If the situation demands more, we will do more, and the enemy is perplexed.”
Consistent with the above sentiment, Sheikh Qassem is emphasizing the above paradigm: “If the situation demands more, we will do more”.
‘Rules of engagement’ between Hezbollah and Israel seem to have completely changed since new norms were established following the failed Israeli attack on Lebanon in 2006.
Between 2006 and October 2023, the established paradigm was as follows: If Israel violates Lebanese sovereignty, Hezbollah reserves the right to retaliate, and it often did. 
What Hezbollah is now saying is that new rules of engagement are in place, meaning that if Israel continues to violate Palestinian rights, Hezbollah reserves the right to retaliate.

‘Escalation’
“If the enemy further intervenes, matters will expand, and we say to those who contact us that they must stop the aggression first to prevent the conflict from escalating”
Regardless of those who are “contacting us”, Sheikh Qassem had a final message to Israel, that unlike US and Israeli claims, it is not Iran or Hezbollah that aim at expanding the conflict, but Israel.
Sheikh Qassem is practically telling Israel that expanding the conflict is directly linked to its current war on Gaza. 
In other words, Hezbollah is making a commitment to Palestinians, that the Resistance in Lebanon will certainly expand the conflict with Israel shall Israel expand its war on the besieged Strip. 
Below is the full statement by Sheikh Qassem.

Hezbollah Deputy to the Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem
The occupation is waging a systematic war of annihilation and destruction targeting civilians, including children, women, and the elderly in Gaza.
Hezbollah is committed to keeping pace and confronting as part of its vision to serve the victory of resistance, the liberation of Palestine and al-Quds, and what serves our nation.
Today, we are in the heart of the battle and achieving accomplishments. There are 3 Israeli brigades facing Hezbollah, while there are 5 brigades facing Gaza.
As events continue to unfold and necessitate our increased involvement, we will do so.
What we are doing in the south now is a stage that aligns with the confrontation. If the situation demands more, we will do more, and the enemy is perplexed.
If the enemy further intervenes, matters will expand, and we say to those who contact us that they must stop the aggression first to prevent the conflict from escalating.
We are not compelled to clarify our plan, and the enemy should suffice with the defeat they have suffered, or else they will face an even greater defeat with no hope for victory.
The Israeli ground incursion into Gaza will be a graveyard for the enemy, and there is nothing ahead of them but defeat, while there is nothing ahead of us but victory.</p>
