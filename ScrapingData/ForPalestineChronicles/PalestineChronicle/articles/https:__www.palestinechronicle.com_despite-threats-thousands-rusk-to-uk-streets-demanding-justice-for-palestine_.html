Despite threats from the UK government to crack down on pro-Palestinian supporters, thousands of demonstrators marched in London on Saturday, calling for an immediate end to the brutal Israeli military aggression on the besieged Gaza Strip.
The British Metropolitan Police issued a warning that anyone showing support for Hamas could face arrest. 
Protesters chanted against British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and  UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman who recently suggested in a letter to police chiefs that waving Palestinian flags and chanting pro-Palestine slogans could be illegal under the Public Order Act. 
Similar protests were held in Manchester, Glasgow, Cambridge, Norwich, and many other cities.

In a statement, a copy of which was sent to The Palestine Chronicle, Shamiul Joarder, Head of Public Affairs at the UK-based organization Friends of Al-Aqsal, said: “Israel’s relentless oppression of Palestinians, and the British government’s complicity in this, must come to an end.”
“We demand that the British government upholds international law and holds Israel accountable for its illegal occupation of Palestinian land, persistent breaches of international law and documented war crimes,” Joarder added.
Over 2,000 Palestinians, including more than 700 children, have been killed in Gaza since Saturday, when Israel launched a military campaign on the besieged Strip.
Basic necessities like food, water, and electricity have been cut off as Israel ordered 1.1 million Palestinians to leave their homes and relocate.
