There are many graphic images that we received from Gaza, but decided not to publish, so as not to dehumanize Gaza, a place of a very special kind of humans. 
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees, displaced yet once more, are calling on the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) to take responsibility for the welfare of Palestinians, especially those taking shelter in UN schools across the devastated Strip.
A 7-year-old boy, Zohid writes daily notes to his friend, Tamer in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Tamer was killed by Israel, but Zohdi refuses to accept or even understand what has happened. “I was hoping to play football at your house,” he wrote on a piece of paper. He received no answer. 
A residential tower in central Gaza was bombed. People were trapped, and hundreds of civilians were evacuated as the blaze made its way from the top of the tower, to the rest of the building.
A distraught doctor rests for a moment, before resuming his work, trying to do the impossible amid an Israeli genocide in Gaza.
