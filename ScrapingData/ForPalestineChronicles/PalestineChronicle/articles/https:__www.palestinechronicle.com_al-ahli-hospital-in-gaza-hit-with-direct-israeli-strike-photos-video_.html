News reports said that the hospital sustained infrastructural damage due to the bombing, complicating the work of already struggling medical facilities throughout the besieged Gaza Strip.
This is the message by Binder:
“ALERT: AHLI HOSPITAL STRUCK BY ISRAELI ROCKET FIRE!
“At about 7:30 pm local time today, Ahli Hospital’s Diagnostic Cancer Treatment Center in Gaza was hit by Israeli rocket fire. The strike severely damaged the two upper floors, including the Ultrasound and Mammography wards.
“Four of the hospital staff working there were injured in the blast and are receiving treatment for their wounds.
“The Diagnostic Center is the Crown Jewel of Ahli Hospital, providing cancer diagnosis as a prelude to various treatment options both at Ahli and in other facilities.
“Next month, we were due to open a new chemotherapy center there in partnership with Augusta Victoria Hospital on the Mount of Olives—a principal reason for our visit to the hospital last week.
“Please continue to pray for the safety of the hospital, its staff, and the patients and refugees who are being housed there.
“And if you have any political influence at all, please have the Israeli government waive off the IDF from bombing our hospital!” 
The Ahly hospital is supported by the American Friends of the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem.
