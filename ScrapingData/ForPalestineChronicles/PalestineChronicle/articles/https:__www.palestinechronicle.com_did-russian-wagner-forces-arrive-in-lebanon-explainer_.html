News reports emerged today, Thursday, November 2, suggesting that the Russian Wagner group has arrived in Lebanon, for the sole purpose of aiding Hezbollah in its fight against Israel. 
Is This True?
Though it cannot be confirmed whether the powerful Russian paramilitary is indeed in Lebanon, and if that is the case, for what specific purpose, we can confirm the following.
The US publication, the Wall Street Journal, reported on Thursday at 2:24 pm ET, that Wagner “plans to provide an air-defense system to Hezbollah.”

What Source did The Wall Street Journal Rely on to Make Such a Claim?
The source, according to the newspaper, is a “US official”, who spoke based on intelligence information. 
What Particular Air Defense System is Wagner Planning to Use in Support of Hezbollah?
WSJ reports, 
“The Russian SA-22 system they plan to send uses antiaircraft missiles and air-defense guns to intercept aircraft.” 
Has the System already Been Deployed?
“One U.S. official said that Washington hasn’t confirmed that the system has been sent. But officials are monitoring discussions involving Wagner and Hezbollah and the potential delivery is a major concern to them.” 
Hezbollah and the Gaza War
Since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza, on October 7, the Lebanese Resistance movement Hezbollah has engaged directly, but relatively in a limited way in the war against the Israeli occupation.
According to Hezbollah sources, the movement has killed, as of November 1, at least 120 soldiers, and wounded many more, while targeting numerous military bases, intelligence installations, and other Israeli positions across the Lebanon-Israel border.

Israel has occupied parts of Lebanon for decades and has only left the country in 2000, following stiff Lebanese resistance under Hezbollah’s leadership. 
It attempted to re-occupy Lebanon in 2006 but failed in what Lebanon considers a major victory against Israel. 
Israel, however, continues to occupy parts of Lebanon, namely the Sheba Farms region.
Hezbollah has vowed to recover every inch of Lebanon that has been occupied by Israel contrary to international law.
