The young climate activist posted a photo of herself holding a sign calling on people to support Gaza.
Renowned climate activist Greta Thunberg published a post on her Instagram account Friday calling for people to “stand with Gaza.” 
The potential Nobel Peace Prize candidate, wrote the following post under the photo: 
“Today we are striking in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza. The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate cease-fire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected.” 
Three other young women were also in the photo, each holding a sign. One sign read, “This Jew Stands with Palestine,” another read “Climate Justice Now,” and a third carried a Palestinian flag with the words “Free Palestine”.  
The young women joined a large number of respected activists, intellectuals, art and culture icons around the world making similar demands. 
UK Artists 
In the UK, thousands of cultural figures signed an open letter calling for an immediate end to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. 
The signatories include Tilda Swinton, Charles Dance, Peter Mulan, Steve Coogan, Miriam Margolyes, Khalid Abdullah and Maxine Beck.
The letter was also signed by directors Michael Winterbottom, Mike Leigh, Asif Kapadia, comedians Frankie Boyle and Josie Long, playwrights Tanika Gupta and Abi Spallen, poet Anthony Anaxagorou, as well as visual artists Tai Shani, Larissa Sansour, Rosalind Nashashibi, Florence Beck, Georgina Starr, and authors Marina Warner, Jacqueline Rose, Gillian Slovo and Courttia Newland.
US Artists 
In the US, many respected artists, actors and other public figures added their voice to those around the world demanding justice for Palestinians. 
One of the first ones to take a stance was rock legend Roger Waters, who voiced his support for the Palestinian people in an article published in the Palestine Chronicle. 
Another star who recently took to social media to weigh in on the bombardment of Gaza is Seattle-based American rapper and artist Macklemore.
The two-time Grammy winner, who has had multiple songs on the Billboard #1, expressed his sympathy for Gaza, which has been undergoing heavy Israeli bombardment that, so far, killed over 4,100 Palestinians:
“I stand for peace. I stand for love. I stand for freedom. And because of that, I stand for a Free Palestine and an end to the looming genocide of its people,” he wrote. 
While expressing sympathy towards “Israelis who lost loved ones,” Macklemore said that “killing innocent civilians in retaliation as a collective punishment is not the answer.”
The renowned artist also highlighted double standards. “We are collectively praying for Israel,” he said, wondering:
“But why are we not doing the same for Palestinians? How are one group of people’s lives worth more than others?”
