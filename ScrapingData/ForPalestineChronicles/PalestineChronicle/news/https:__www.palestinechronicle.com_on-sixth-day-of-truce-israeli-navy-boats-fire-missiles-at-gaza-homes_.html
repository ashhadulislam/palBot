Over the past three days, the occupation forces violated the humanitarian truce more than once, targeting farmers east of the Al-Maghazi camp, killing one and injuring another.
Israeli occupation navy boats fired a number of missiles at the coast of Khan Yunis, Al-Shati, and Sheikh Radwan in the Gaza Strip, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
This coincides with the sixth and final day of the truce, which was extended two days ago.
Media sources told WAFA that Israeli boats fired at Palestinians’ homes in the areas west of Khan Yunis, Al-Shati Camp, Sheikh Radwan, and other areas adjacent to and opposite the coast of the Strip, without any casualties being reported.
