The al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, announced in a statement that it destroyed, “in whole or in part”, on Wednesday 11 Israeli military vehicles, and that it killed and wounded Israeli soldiers in all axes of fighting in the Gaza Strip.
Al-Qassam Brigades said that it targeted an occupation army force east of Juhr al-Dik, in the eastern Gaza Strip, using anti-armor and anti-personnel devices.
It added that its fighters confirmed that they had killed and wounded a number of Israeli soldiers.

Clashes
Meanwhile, clashes continued between Palestinian Resistance fighters and Israeli vehicles infiltrating into several areas of Gaza City and other areas in the Gaza Strip.
The clashes are taking place in areas near central Gaza, in the southwest and northwest of the city, as well as in areas in the northern Gaza Strip, such as Beit Hanoun.
In the east of Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, Resistance fighters shelled a gathering of Israeli vehicles penetrating into the area, according to a statement by the Qassam Brigades.
In another development, the military media of the Qassam Brigades broadcast pictures of rocket barrages fired by the Resistance today from the Gaza Strip towards Israeli targets.
While Israel said it would continue its military operations until Hamas was eliminated, the Resistance vowed to make Gaza a graveyard for invading Israeli soldiers.

Death Toll
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,500 Palestinians, including 4,710 children.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
