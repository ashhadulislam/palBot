Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez said that “What we are seeing in Gaza is not acceptable” and that he has “serious doubt (Israel) is complying with international humanitarian law”.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Minister of Foreign Affairs Eli Cohen on Thursday to summon the Spanish Ambassador to Israel “for a reprimand” following comments by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, the Israeli government announced.
In an interview with Spanish state-owned broadcaster TVE, Sanchez said “What we are seeing in Gaza is not acceptable.”
“The footage we are seeing and the growing numbers of children dying, I have serious doubt (Israel) is complying with international humanitarian law,” Sanchez added.
Israel had already summoned Spain’s ambassador last week when Sanchez and his Belgian counterpart Alexander de Croo made similar comments at the Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossing.
On that occasion, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said that the remarks repeated “false claims” and “gave terrorism a boost”. Cohen then announced he had summoned the ambassadors of both countries.
Until a ceasefire was announced on Friday, November 24, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza announced that over 15,000 Palestinians, including over 6,150 children and more than 4,000, with another 36,000 wounded.
