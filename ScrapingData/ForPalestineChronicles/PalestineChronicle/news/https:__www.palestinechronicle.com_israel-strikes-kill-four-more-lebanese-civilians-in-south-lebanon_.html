Three Lebanese citizens, including Al-Mayadeen correspondent Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih Al-Me’mari, were killed earlier on Tuesday when an Israeli strike targeted media crews in the town of Tair Harfa in South Lebanon.

“The intentional killing of our beloved colleagues Farah and Rabih comes after the Israeli war cabinet approved on November 13 regulations that would allow the occupation government to ban and shut down Al-Mayadeen Media Network,” Al-Mayadeen reported.
Since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza, on October 7, the Lebanese Resistance movement Hezbollah has engaged directly, but relatively in a limited way in the war against the Israeli occupation.
Hezbollah targeted numerous military bases, intelligence installations, and other Israeli positions across the Lebanon-Israel border.

Israel has occupied parts of Lebanon for decades and has only left the country in 2000, following stiff Lebanese resistance under Hezbollah’s leadership.
It attempted to re-occupy Lebanon in 2006 but failed in what Lebanon considers a major victory against Israel.
Israel, however, continues to occupy parts of Lebanon, namely the Sheeba Farms region.
Hezbollah has vowed to recover every inch of Lebanon that has been occupied by Israel contrary to international law.
