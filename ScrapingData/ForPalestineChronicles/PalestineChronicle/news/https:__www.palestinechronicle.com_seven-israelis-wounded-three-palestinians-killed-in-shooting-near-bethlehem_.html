The statement added that seven Israelis were injured and that they were transferred to a hospital for medical treatment. According to the Israeli Ambulance Service, one of the wounded is in critical condition. 
Following the incident, the Israeli army sealed off all entrances to the governorate of Bethlehem, the closest to the military checkpoint between Jerusalem and the south of the occupied West Bank, according to WAFA.
The Israeli army also closed the road where the incident took place as Israeli soldiers were deployed on roads leading to several nearby West Bank villages and towns.
