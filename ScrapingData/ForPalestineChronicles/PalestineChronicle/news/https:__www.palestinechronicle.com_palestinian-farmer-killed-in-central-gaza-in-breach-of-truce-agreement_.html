This incident adds to the rising toll of casualties during the temporary humanitarian pause, with seven more civilians being shot by Israeli occupation forces in the vicinity of the Al-Quds and Indonesian hospitals in northern Gaza on Sunday morning.
The Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli government have agreed to a four-day truce that will see the release of 50 women and children held in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons.
The deal was announced on Wednesday and the starting time is expected to be confirmed in the next 24 hours, according to a statement from Qatar, which mediated the agreement.
