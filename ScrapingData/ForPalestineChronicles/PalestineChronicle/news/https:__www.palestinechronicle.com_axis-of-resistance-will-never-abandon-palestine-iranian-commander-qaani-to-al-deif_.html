The commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Esmail Qaani, praised the achievements of the Palestinian Resistance in a letter to Mohammed al-Deif, the commander of Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinian Resistance Movement Hamas.

“The strikes launched by the Resistance against the enemy’s forces and tanks have shown to everyone that the Resistance in Gaza is perfectly capable of taking initiative and decisive action,” the IRGC chief added.
The region “will not be as it was before the al-Aqsa Flood (Operation – PC),” Qaani stated.
Qaani also said that Gaza is defending today the “honor, pride, and dignity of the Ummah,” underlining that “your brothers standing with you in the Axis of al-Quds and Resistance will not allow the enemy and those behind it to dominate Gaza and its people.”
“(The Axis of Resistance -PC) will not allow the enemy to achieve its malicious goals in Gaza and Palestine.”

Moreover, he extended his congratulations to al-Deif, the Palestinian Resistance, as well as the people of occupied Palestine for the significant victory and unprecedented achievements they have made against the Israeli occupation.
“We reaffirm the covenant, pledge, and the religious and fraternal commitment that unites us, and we assure you that, within our continued protection and influential support for the Resistance, we will do everything necessary in this historical battle,” Qaani stressed in the conclusion of his letter to the renowned Resistance leader.

“The Zionist regime, the killer of children, has entered a stage of deterioration after the Al-Aqsa Flood,” he said. 
“What is happening today in Gaza has unveiled the true face of the United States and the Western supporters of the Zionist regime.”
Iran’s Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, has urged an immediate cessation of the brutal Israeli aggression on Gaza, emphasizing that Israel has no possibility of winning the war.
“Unfortunately, the scope of the Zionist regime’s attacks on Gaza is expanding, and it is necessary to take immediate and effective measures to stop them,” he said.
“There is no chance for the Zionist regime to win the war, and it will only increase the costs for the US government as the biggest supporter of the Zionist regime that is responsible for the continuation of the aggression. As a result, it is necessary to focus efforts on a ceasefire and an immediate halt to the war,” Amir-Abdollahian added.
