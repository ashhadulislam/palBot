“No third party or international organization was permitted to be present inside, which raises doubts about any Israeli narrative that would be released later.”
Israeli forces stormed the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza City on Wednesday, turning it into military barracks and a detention center, the Euro-Med Monitor said in a statement.
“Euro-Med Monitor expressed fears of killings and executions as its team documented sporadic gunfire in the hospital since the early minutes of the raid,” the statement read, adding that “the al-Shifa Complex did not witness any gunfire other than from the Israeli forces.”

The Geneva-based right group also stated that “the Israeli army is the only party controlling the scene inside the al-Shifa Medical Complex” as “no third party or international organization was permitted to be present inside, which raises doubts about any Israeli narrative that would be released later.”
“The Israeli army has deliberately exaggerated over the past few days the goal of storming the al-Shifa Complex, portraying it as a military achievement, and inciting its soldiers against the medical facility,” the statement also said.
