The Israeli decision ordered the crossing to be cleared out of trucks on the Palestinian side as soon as possible.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) announced on Friday that Israeli occupation forces have blocked the entry of aid through the Rafah land crossing, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
PRCS said in a statement that Israeli authorities have informed it of its decision to prevent organizations working at the Rafah Land Crossing from bringing aid trucks from the Egyptian side into the Gaza Strip starting on Friday night and until further notice.
The Israeli decision ordered the crossing to be cleared out of trucks on the Palestinian side as soon as possible.
PRCS stressed that this decision escalates the suffering of citizens, and further amplifies challenges faced by humanitarian and relief organizations attempting to alleviate the suffering of citizens and displaced persons in light of the ongoing Israeli aggression on the Strip.

The Israeli occupation resumed its aggression on the Gaza Strip Friday at 7:00 AM, only minutes after six days of humanitarian truce.
A four-day truce began on Friday, November 24, was extended twice, and ended on Friday, December 1, at 7 am local time today.
The truce allowed – for the first time since the start of Israel’s aggression on the Strip on October 7 – the entry of humanitarian and relief aid trucks. However, the quantity of aid and fuel trucks was inadequate to meet the growing needs of civilians in light of the current humanitarian crisis in the Strip.
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes across various areas of Gaza since Friday morning, as Israel resumed its aggression after a seven-day truce, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said in a statement.
Since October 7, over 15,000 Palestinians, including over 6,150 children and more than 4,000 women were killed, with another 36,000 wounded, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
