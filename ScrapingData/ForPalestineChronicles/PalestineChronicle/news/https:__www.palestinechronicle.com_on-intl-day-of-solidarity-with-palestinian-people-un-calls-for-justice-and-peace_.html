On the occasion of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people, the United Nations issued a statement calling for “justice and peace” amid “escalating violence in Gaza.”
“As the world observes the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People on 29 November 2023, United Nations Member States engage in a moment of introspection and rededication to the cause of peace,” the statement read, adding:
“The observance arrives amid a surge in violence in Israel and Gaza unseen in recent history. This has not only claimed thousands of lives but has also resulted in the displacement of over 1.7 million people.
Such tragic events underscore the urgency to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, a subject that has long stood as one of the international community’s most formidable challenges.”
November 29 marks the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People when the United Nations General Assembly adopted Partition Resolution 181 in 1947.
The resolution provided for the establishment of a Jewish state and an Arab state, with Jerusalem as a corpus separatum under a special international regime.

“This year, such demonstrations of solidarity would resonate with an urgent call to cease hostilities, to end the occupation of Palestinian territory, to release all hostages and persons arbitrarily detained, and to re-engage in a dialogue that could establish the foundations of sustainable peace and an independent Palestinian State,” the statement said.
“On this International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, the Committee calls on all to rekindle the spirit of resolution 181 (II)—not as a reminder of division but as a symbol of hope for a future where two States, Israel and Palestine, can exist side by side in harmony, peace and security,” the statement concluded.
