Palestinians in Lebanon are being called to join the ‘Vanguards of Al-Aqsa Flood’. 
The call was made by the Palestinian Resistance Movement Hamas in a statement on Monday.
This announcement is made as an “affirmation of the role of the Palestinian people in all their places of presence in resisting the occupation by all available and legitimate means”.
Since the start of the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation and the Israeli war on Gaza on October 7, the powerful Lebanese Resistance Movement Hezbollah has played an essential role in the fight against Israel.

Hezbollah’s role was not confined to targeting Israeli military bases in northern Israel and in Lebanese occupied regions, as it also opened space for Hamas fighters, and other resistance groups, to engage with the Israeli army from Lebanese territories. 
It was this operational space that is now being used as a platform to strengthen the ranks of the Resistance with more Palestinian fighters, especially from the south.  
The movement in Lebanon called on the Palestinian people and all young men and men to join the vanguard of the resistance and participate in “shaping the future of your people, and in the liberation of Al-Quds and the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque.”
Below are excerpts from the statement issued by ‘Hamas-Lebanon’, as communicated in the group’s Military Media through its Telegram Channel: 
“The Hamas movement in Lebanon announces the establishment of ‘Vanguards of Al-Aqsa Flood’ and calls on Palestinian youth to join it. 
“O sons of our Palestinian people in Lebanon; O brave fighters:
“(In) affirmation of the role of the Palestinian people in all their places of presence in resisting the occupation by all available and legitimate means, (and) as a continuation of what was achieved in the Al-Aqsa Flood operation .. :
“The Islamic Resistance Movement – Hamas in Lebanon, announces the establishment and launch of the ‘Vanguards of the Flood of Al-Aqsa’.
“So, O sons of our people, O brave youth and men, join the vanguards of the Resistance fighters, and participate in shaping the future of your people, and in the liberation of Al-Quds and the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque.
“Indeed, it is a jihad…of victory or martyrdom.
“The Islamic Resistance Movement – Hamas, in Lebanon. Beirut, 4 December 2023.”
