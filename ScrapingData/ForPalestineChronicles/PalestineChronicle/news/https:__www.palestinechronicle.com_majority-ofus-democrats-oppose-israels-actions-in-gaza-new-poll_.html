A new poll reveals that the majority of US Democrats disapprove of Israel’s military actions in the Gaza Strip.
The poll was conducted by Gallup from November 1-21 and published on November 30. The polling ended before the recent seven-day truce deal, which led to several prisoner exchanges between the Israeli authorities and the Palestinian Resistance movement Hamas.
While the slight public opinion tilts in favor of Israel’s actions, the majority of Democrats disapprove of Israel’s military conduct in the besieged Gaza Strip.
GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY: The number of Palestinians killed by Israel during the latest aggression has risen to 15,899. 70 % are women and children.
