Emergency medical teams of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) remain besieged at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in the Gaza Strip, and cannot treat the wounded as a result of Israeli airstrikes. 
“Israeli tanks are stationed in the hospital’s vicinity, amidst heavy gunfire from Israeli soldiers,” the organization said in a post on its X page on Friday.
“We demand immediate intervention to protect our teams that are now in danger.”
Earlier, it posted that “there are several casualties in the hospital courtyard about 30 meters away from our teams but they are unable to reach.”

It reported that Israeli forces’ armored vehicles had surrounded the Al-Ahli Hospital, the only medical facility in the northern Gaza Strip and its capital that continues to operate and receive patients.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reportedly says more than 500 people were housed there as of November 14.

The PRCS also pointed out that due to the constant Israeli shelling, rescue workers and paramedics working with the Red Crescent Society in Gaza are facing extremely difficult conditions and are not protected from attacks as the military operations in the region continue.
According to the organization, at least four members of the PRCS have been killed and 22 others injured since tensions escalated on October 7.
It said that “despite the 41st consecutive day of Israeli aggression, the PRCS paramedics continue their humanitarian duty amid the challenging conditions and the psychological impact of witnessing daily bloodshed.” At the same time, they are still separated from their families and children.
