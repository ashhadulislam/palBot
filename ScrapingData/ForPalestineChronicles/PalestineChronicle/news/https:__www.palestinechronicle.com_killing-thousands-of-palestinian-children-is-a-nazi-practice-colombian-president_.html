Colombian President Gustavo Petro has described Israeli airstrikes on the besieged Gaza Strip as a “Nazi practice”.
“They claim this is not Nazi-like; killing 5,300 Palestinian boys and girls is a Nazi practice, despite the West’s reluctance to acknowledge this truth,” Petro wrote on the social media platform X. 
The tweet was accompanied by footage of the areas subjected to Israeli bombardment in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip.
Dicen que esto no es de Nazis. Asi no le guste a la conciencia occidental estos hechos, el exterminio de 5.300 niños y niñas pañestinos es de Nazis, repito de NAZIS. https://t.co/BYlnSdiF0T

This is not the first time President Petro has drawn parallels between Israeli atrocities and Nazi practices. 
He previously characterized Israeli airstrikes on Gaza as “Nazi-like” and asserted that Gaza is witnessing genocide.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes across various areas of Gaza since Friday morning, as Israel resumed its aggression after a seven-day truce, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said in a statement.
