Five Palestinians were killed, 11 injured and 14 arrested during Israel’s latest military reaid in the city and refugee camp of Jenin.
Israeli occupation forces killed five Palestinians during a military raid in the city and refugee camp of Jenin, north of the occupied West Bank, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
Eyewitnesses reported that an Israeli military drone targeted a house in the Damaj neighborhood within the Jenin refugee camp, using at least one missile.
This led to the killing of Asaad Ali Damaj, a 33-year-old man, and left 11 others injured, including three women. Furthermore, Israeli drones targeted the Public Service Center in the camp.

The incursion involved a large-scale Israeli military presence accompanied by military bulldozers. The occupation forces stormed Jenin from multiple directions, firing live rounds as they besieged the city.
During the raid, the occupation army besieged the Jenin Public Hospital, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) local branch, and the Ibn Sina Hospital.
Israeli occupation forces also deployed snipers on the rooftops of some buildings and bulldozed several streets in the city and the vicinity of the refugee camp.
The Israeli aggression ended up in the morning with five casualties, including a child, and many injuries from live ammunition.
