Nofooth Hammad, 16, was supposed to be released from Israeli prisons, but she has never arrived home. Now her father says that she was re-arrested.
In clear violation of the terms for the exchange of prisoners, the Israeli occupation authorities re-arrested the child prisoner, Nofoth Hammad, 16, after she was supposed to be released on Friday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
Nofooth Hammad, 16, was supposed to be released from Israeli prisons as part of the truce agreement between the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli government but she has never arrived home, according to her father Jad Hammad.

Hammad told WAFA that the Israeli occupation forces assaulted his daughter while she was being transported to Jerusalem to be released.
Nofooth was later transferred to the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem after she was injured in the assault.
Her father and the lawyer were not allowed to visit her in the hospital and were never informed about her situation.
Hammad told WAFA that the Israeli occupation authorities took her out of the hospital on Monday and returned her to prison. He expressed concern for his daughter’s health condition.
Al-Qassam Brigades released footage of the release of the third batch of Israeli captives, in Gaza City.

According to WAFA, the reason for her re-arrest could be the objection of a Jewish settler to her release.
Nofooth Hammad is the youngest child detained in Israeli prisons. She was detained by Israeli occupation forces in December 2021, when she was only 14, and sentenced to 12 years in prison.
