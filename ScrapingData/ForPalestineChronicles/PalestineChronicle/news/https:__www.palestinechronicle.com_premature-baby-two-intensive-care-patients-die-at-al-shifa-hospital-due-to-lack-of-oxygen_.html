The death toll in the hospital rose to 15 in the last 48 hours, including six premature babies and nine intensive care patients.
A premature baby and two intensive care patients at the besieged Shifa Medical Center in Gaza City died on Monday because of a lack of oxygen due to a depletion of fuel that runs the hospital’s electric generator, medical sources said.
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that, with the death of these patients, the death toll in the hospital rose to 15 in the last 48 hours, including six premature babies and nine intensive care patients.
Al-Shifa Medical Center, the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip, is still under full Israeli military siege as soldiers and drones target anyone who moves in its vicinity.

Currently, there are more than 60 patients in intensive care, more than 30 infants in the premature and nursery ward, and more than 500 patients in the hospital’s dialysis department.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,180 Palestinians, including 4,609 children. 
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
