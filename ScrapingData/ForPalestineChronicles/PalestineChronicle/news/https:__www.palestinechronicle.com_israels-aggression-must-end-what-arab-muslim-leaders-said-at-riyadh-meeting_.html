The Arab and Muslim leaders held the West responsible for the humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip due to their blind support for Tel Aviv’s actions.
The participants of the extraordinary joint summit of the League of Arab States (LAS) and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Riyadh agreed on Saturday that it is necessary to stop Israel’s military operations as soon as possible, organize the delivery of aid to the peaceful population and create functioning security mechanisms, TASS reported.
The Arab and Muslim leaders held the West responsible for the humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip due to their blind support for Tel Aviv’s actions.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed regret that “Western countries, which always talk about human rights and freedoms, remain silent in the face of the continued killing of Palestinians.”
“The West and Israel, which behaves like a spoiled child of this West, should compensate for the damage, the destruction caused to the Palestinians,” Erdogan added.
Erdogan also said that Ankara is ready to participate in the establishment and operation of a security guarantee mechanism for the Palestinians, including a system of guarantor countries.

The Turkish leader noted that the guarantee system “will be able to provide security not only for the Palestinians but also for the Israelis and the entire region.”
Erdogan noted that “The most urgent thing is not a pause in hostilities for a few hours, but a permanent ceasefire.”
The other speakers agreed that the first step to ending the conflict should be a suspension of hostilities in Gaza.
As Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud said, it is necessary to cease Israeli hostilities, force Hamas to release hostages, and put an end to the forced displacement of the population of Gaza.
For his part, Crown Prince of Kuwait Salem Abdullah al-Jaber al-Sabah pointed out that the entire world community, and in particular the UN Security Council, should “assume its direct responsibility and immediately stop the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip.”

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said that Cairo insists on the formation of a concrete mechanism to achieve a just settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict based on the idea of two independent states. “It is also the turn of the international community to exert maximum efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state,” he said.
Some of the leaders have suggested increased pressure on Israel.
Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani called on the United Nations to send an international investigation team to Gaza to determine the extent of Israeli responsibility for attacks on civilian targets, including health facilities.
Syrian President Bashar Assad said that “effective steps, not verbal rhetoric, are needed at this moment” to stop the war.
“Arab countries must limit their contacts with Israel in order to stop the fighting in Gaza,” he pointed out.
Islamic and Arab countries agreed on a call to get an advisory ruling from the International Court of Justice against Israel and to remove all WMD's – including Israeli nuclear weapons – from the region.

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi held the United States accountable.
“America is constantly sending a message to Iran and some other countries that the scope of the war should not be expanded, but this statement is not in line with America’s actions,” he said.
“America has blocked the ceasefire in Gaza and is expanding the scope of the war.”
Raisi called for using “all means” to force the US and Israel to stop the fighting in Gaza, including suggesting that Islamic countries arm the Palestinians to fight Israel if the fighting in the enclave does not stop.
