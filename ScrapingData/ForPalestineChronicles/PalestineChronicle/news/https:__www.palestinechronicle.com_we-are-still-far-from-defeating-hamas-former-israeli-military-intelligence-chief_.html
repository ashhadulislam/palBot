The defeat of the Palestinian Resistance Movement Hamas remains elusive, the former chief of the Israeli army’s Military Intelligence Division said on Tuesday, Anadolu News Agency reported.
In an analysis published by Israeli Channel 12, Tamir Hayman said a lot of work still needs to be done by the Israeli army in the northern region of the Gaza Strip.
ISRAELI CHANNEL 12: The Iron Dome system attempted to intercept Palestinian missiles in the sky of Tel Aviv.
Eyewitnesses spoke of about ten explosions that rocked the city. Israeli ambulance teams were heading to locations in Tel Aviv where rockets had been reported.

“We must buy time as we have no other choice, and our deterrence and security in the Middle East will only guarantee us an overwhelming victory,” he said.
“The conclusion at present is that we are still far from that,” he added.
Hayman believes that eliminating Hamas is a challenge that requires destroying at least 60 percent of the group’s military capabilities.

In his view, the fighting in the southern Gaza Strip will be even “more complicated” as the area is heavily populated.
“After about one million additional people moved from Gaza’s north to south with around two million people now living in an area of about 200 square kilometers (some 78 square miles),” Hayman explained. 
The Al-Qassam Brigades just released a video reportedly showing part of the operation to monitor the Israeli army's tents before planting explosive devices and detonating them on December 4, in the Juhr al-Dik area, east of central #Gaza.
