The Israeli retreat came hours before the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli government agreed to a four-day truce.
Israeli military vehicles have retreated over the past 48 hours, while maintaining their presence in the northern Gaza Strip, in an apparent attempt to reposition themselves into “relatively safe points”, Anadolu news agency reported on Wednesday.
Quoting eyewitnesses, the agency’s correspondent said the Israeli forces have retreated to a distance of more than three kilometers towards the west from the Al-Sabra neighborhood and the western outskirts of the Al-Zaytoun neighborhood all the way to Al-Shifa Medical Complex.
111 Palestinians were buried today in a mass grave in Khan Yunis, after they were detained by the Israeli occupation forces in Al-Shifa Medical Complex and Beit Hanoun Hospital a few days ago.

The Israeli forces have also retreated from the western-southern areas in the Tal Al-Hawa and Al-Remal neighborhoods, all the way to Al-Rashid Street on the shore of Gaza Sea, according to eyewitnesses and local sources.
In the northern Gaza Strip, the Israeli occupation forces maintained their positions in open areas of the towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia.
They also reportedly maintained their positions in the town of Jabalia, after reaching the vicinity of the Indonesian Hospital.
The Israeli retreat came hours before the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli government agreed to a four-day truce.
The agreement will see the release of 50 women and children held in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons.
Despite the announcement of a temporary truce that will take effect in 24 hours, the Israeli occupation army intensified its bombing of civilians in the Gaza Strip while continuing to besiege its hospitals.https://t.co/Ii7eYswNwD pic.twitter.com/S9mhOdtOS6

The deal was announced on Wednesday and the starting time is expected to be confirmed in the next 24 hours, according to a statement from Qatar.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 14,128 Palestinians, including 5,840 children and 3,920 women. More than 31,000 Palestinians were wounded.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
