Detention Campaign Continues
Israeli occupation forces stormed other areas of the occupied West Bank, continuing their relentless mass detention campaign.
According to the Prisoners’ Commission and the Prisoner’s Society, most of the arrests were in the Jerusalem, Ramallah and Hebron governorates, while others were detained in Jericho, Nablus, Qalqilya, and Jenin areas.
Detainees were beaten, some severely, and their homes ransacked, said the groups.
Israel has detained more than 2520 Palestinians in the occupied territories since October 7, most at their homes while others at checkpoints or after turning themselves in after holding members of their families as hostages.
