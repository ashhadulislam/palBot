A ceasefire agreement between Palestinian resistance groups and Israel was reached through Egyptian and Qatari efforts.
The details of the agreement are much closer to Hamas’, not Israel’s, conditions of an extended truce and significant humanitarian aid.
The next few hours are crucial to the success of the ceasefire. News reports speak of intense Israeli bombardment of various residential targets in central Gaza. Many bodies are also being pulled from the rubble of destroyed homes.
