On November 19, Yemen’s Armed Forces, allied with the Ansarallah resistance movement, announced that they would target all vessels associated with Israel.
The US Central Command (CENTCOM) announced on Monday that two ballistic missiles had been launched from areas in Yemen controlled by the Yemeni Armed Forces, allied with the Ansarallah Resistance Movement, toward an American destroyer in the Gulf of Aden.
“At approximately 0141 on Nov. 27 Sanaa time, two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen toward the general location of the USS Mason (DDG 87) and M/V Central Park,” CENTCOM said on X.
The USS Mason was responding to a distress call from the M/V Central Park, a commercial vessel that had been reportedly attacked by an “unknown entity”, according to the statement.

“Upon arrival, coalition elements demanded release of the vessel. Subsequently, five armed individuals debarked the ship and attempted to flee via their small boat. The MASON pursued the attackers resulting in their eventual surrender,” the statement added.
The incident came after an Israeli-owned tanker was seized and later let go by armed assailants off the coast of Yemen on Sunday. 
On November 19, Yemen’s Armed Forces, allied with the Ansarallah resistance movement, announced that they would target all vessels associated with Israel in the Red Sea, calling on countries to withdraw their citizens operating on such ships.
“To provide relief to our oppressed people in Gaza,” the armed forces announced, “they will target … ships carrying the flag of the Zionist entity, ships operated by Israeli companies, ships owned by Israeli companies.”
