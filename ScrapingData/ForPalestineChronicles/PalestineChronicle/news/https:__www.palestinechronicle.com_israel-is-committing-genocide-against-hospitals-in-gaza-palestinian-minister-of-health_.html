Palestinian Minister of Health, Mai Alkaila, said on Saturday that the Israeli occupation is committing genocide against the entire healthcare system in the Gaza Strip, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
Speaking at a press conference held at the ministry’s headquarters in Ramallah, Alkaila called on the United Nations, international health organizations, and the International Committee of the Red Cross to exert pressure on Israel to allow the transport of the remaining children and patients from Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza to hospitals in the West Bank or Egypt.
Alkaila held Israeli authorities fully responsible for their lives.

“How long hospitals, patients, and medical teams in Gaza and the West Bank would remain hostages to the onslaught, destruction, targeting, and blockade by the Israeli occupation forces without accountability or condemnation from the international community?” she questioned.
Alkaila highlighted that no hospital in Gaza has the capacity to accommodate the massive number of wounded under nonstop Israeli bombardment.
“Where is the stance of doctors and healthcare professionals worldwide regarding the atrocities committed against their colleagues in the Palestinian healthcare sector in Gaza and the West Bank?” Alkaila addressed the global health community.
