The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate announced that 67 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip on October 7.
In a press release, the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate announced the recent killing of three colleagues, a Media professor of Gaza University, Adham Hassoneh, and two cameramen, Abdullah Darwish and Montaser Al-Sawaf.
Their killing brings the total number of journalists and media workers killed in Gaza since the beginning of the aggression on October 7 to 67.
Mohammed al-Laham, head of the Freedoms Committee at the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, said that monitoring and documenting data is very difficult, due to the continued intensive Israeli attacks.

Al-Laham also noted that the syndicate has lost contact with two journalists since the first day of the aggression. They were identified as Nidal al-Wahidi and Haytham Abed al-Wahad. Their fate is unknown.
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA cited al-Laham as saying that the committee is also unable to confirm if female journalist Ala’a al-Hasanat is alive. 
Despite sources reporting that she may be alive, the committee has not been able to confirm it, according to WAFA.
