“The barbaric bombardment of the Gaza Strip and Israel’s invasion of the enclave, which have left more than 14,000 civilians killed and at least 32,000 wounded, are clear examples of war crimes,” the ministry said.
“They must be looked at as crimes against humanity and acts of genocide,” the statement reads.
“The Iranian foreign minister has called this hearing in the ICC a test for the independence and impartiality of the judicial body,” the statement said. “He added that the ICC must now decide whether to resist the pressure exerted on it by some powers or to back down and allow the atrocities committed by Israel to go unpunished.”
