UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan received Israeli President Isaac Herzog just hours before Israel resumed its airstrikes on Gaza.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Thursday asked United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to use his “political weight” to help free the prisoners currently held by Hamas in Gaza, Reuters news agency reported.
Herzog made the request during a meeting with Sheikh Mohamed in Dubai, according to a statement issued by the Israeli president’s media office.

“The President appealed to his friend Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to employ his full political weight to promote and speed up the return home of the hostages,” the statement said.
A few hours later, on Friday morning, Israel resumed its airstrikes on various areas in the Gaza Strip, moments after the end of the humanitarian truce.
A four-day truce began on Friday, November 24, was extended twice, and ended on Friday, December 1, at 7 am local time today.

The Palestinian Health Ministry announced on Friday afternoon that over 100 Palestinians have been killed since the resumption of the Israeli aggression.
In August 2020, the UAE agreed to a “full normalization of relations” with Israel in an agreement that former US President Donald Trump reportedly helped broker.
The agreement is considered a severe blow to Palestinian efforts aimed at isolating Israel regionally and internationally until it ends its military occupation and apartheid-like system in occupied Palestine.
