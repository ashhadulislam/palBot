Erdogan pointed out that some 3,000 lawyers, including Turkish ones, have filed petitions with the ICC in connection with Israel’s actions in Gaza.
Türkiye will do everything possible for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to punish Israel for the genocide in the Gaza Strip, the country’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters upon his return from Dubai, where he participated in the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28).
“We will do our best to get the International Criminal Court to punish (Israel) for this genocide. This is a black mark not only on (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu’s government, but also on those countries that unconditionally support it. And they too will pay for their silence for years to come,” he said.
“The world will not forget this indifference,” Anadolu news agency quoted Erdogan as saying.
Erdogan pointed out that some 3,000 lawyers, including Turkish ones, have filed petitions with the ICC in connection with Israel’s actions in Gaza.
“About three thousand lawyers have submitted the necessary applications to the ICC in The Hague. (…) These people will follow the trial in The Hague. We expect that these butchers of Gaza, the authors of genocide, especially Netanyahu, who were caught red-handed, will receive the necessary punishment,” the Turkish leader said.
Erdogan also said that Türkiye would step up efforts to hold Israel accountable.
“We will not forget this genocide and we will not let others forget it. Sooner or later, Israel will certainly pay for it. (…) We will continue our efforts in the international arena to stop the Israeli attacks in Gaza and ensure a permanent ceasefire,” he said.
About 300 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes across various areas of Gaza since Friday morning, as Israel resumed its aggression after a seven-day truce, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said in a statement.
A four-day truce began on Friday, November 24, was extended twice, and ended on Friday, December 1, at 7 am local time today.
Since October 7, over 15,207 Palestinians, including over 6,200 children and more than 4,000 women were killed, with another 40,652 wounded, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
