Israeli forces carried out raids on several homes and conducted on-site investigations with residents, the mayor added. They also inspected surveillance footage from commercial establishments and residences in the town.
Jaber stated that, in the early hours of the morning, Israeli occupation forces arrested three workers from Gaza who had been residing in the town after being expelled from their workplaces in Israel following the outbreak of the Israeli war.
