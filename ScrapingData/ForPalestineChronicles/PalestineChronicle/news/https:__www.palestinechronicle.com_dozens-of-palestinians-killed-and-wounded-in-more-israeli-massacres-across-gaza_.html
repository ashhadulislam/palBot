Israeli airstrikes have resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians over the last few hours, as the Israeli aggression on Gaza enters its 37th consecutive day.
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that rescue and civil defense teams retrieved the bodies of four Palestinians from the Hamdan family home in the Sabra neighborhood of Gaza City, which was targeted by an Israeli missile strike at dawn.
Israeli warplanes also targeted a house belonging to Abdullah al-Adini, a local Palestinian resident in the city of Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, resulting in the murder of three Palestinians and the injury of dozens, with some still missing under the rubble.
An old man sat before his orphaned grandchildren and tearfully addressed them, “Tell the Messenger of Allah that the world has abandoned us in Gaza.”

Meantime, at least 10 Palestinians were murdered and more than 20 were injured in an Israeli airstrike targeting the al-Najjar family’s house east of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, the region that Israel claims to be a safe zone.
The headquarters of the United Nations Development Programme in Gaza was also hit by Israeli airstrikes, leading to the murder of five displaced individuals and the injury of 15 others.
Medical sources reported that four people, including a child and two women, were killed as a result of the bombing of a house owned by the Al-Raqab family in the town of Bani Suhaila, east of Khan Yunis.
There is no safe space in Gaza.

Two others were killed as a result of Israel’s bombing of the Al-Zoghbi family house, southeast of Khan Yunis.
Israeli aircraft also bombed a house belonging to the Radwan family in Bani Suhaila, killing a number of people and wounding dozens of others.
Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,100 – including more than 8,000 children and women.
