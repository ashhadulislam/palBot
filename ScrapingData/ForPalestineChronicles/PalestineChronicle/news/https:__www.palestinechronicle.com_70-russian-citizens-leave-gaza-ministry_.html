At least 70 Russian citizens have been evacuated from Gaza to Egypt via the Rafah Border Crossing, which remains the only way out of the besieged Palestinian enclave, Russia’s Emergencies Ministry has announced.
The ministry said in a statement on Telegram on Sunday that its staff has been providing medical and psychological assistance to people as they cross to the Egyptian side. The evacuees are also offered food and water.
“Over the course of the week, the task force of the Emergencies Ministry worked to coordinate the procedure and routes for the evacuation of Russian citizens, who found themselves in the area of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” the ministry said.
All Russian passport holders will be driven from the border to the Egyptian capital, Cairo, where the operational headquarters of the Emergencies Ministry has been set up, the statement read.
There, they will be assisted to prepare all the necessary papers to depart for Russia or other destinations, it added.

The evacuees spoke about the hardships they faced as they spent more than a month under the Israeli blockade in Gaza, which has been relentlessly bombarded by the Israeli army, while water, electricity, and internet access have been cut off.
Some people said that their children became sick due to the poor-quality water that was available.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,100 Palestinians. Vast majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
