Israeli occupation artillery and drones also bombed the vicinity of Kamal Adwan Hospital in the Jabaliya Camp.
108 slain civilians and dozens of casualties were reportedly taken to the Kamal Adwan Hospital, which is still sheltering more than 7,000 displaced Palestinians.
Medical teams were unable to perform any surgical operations in the hospital due to a power outage. 
Medical sources warned of a massacre that Israel might commit inside Kamal Adwan Hospital, as happened in the Al-Shifa and Indonesian hospitals.
