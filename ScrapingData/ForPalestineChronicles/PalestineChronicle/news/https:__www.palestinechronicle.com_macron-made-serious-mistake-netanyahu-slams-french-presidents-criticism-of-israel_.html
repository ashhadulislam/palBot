Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged Western leaders not to bow to pressure from those calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying that French President Emmanuel Macron “made a mistake” by urging the Israeli army to stop bombing civilians in Gaza, RT reported.
During a press conference on Saturday, Netanyahu said that Israel was “truly doing everything to minimize harm to civilians” but would not give Hamas “a license” to murder its citizens without a response, according to the Times of Israel. 
On Friday, Macron said that “de facto – today – civilians are bombed,” pointing out that “there is no reason for that and no legitimacy,” urging Israel to stop. He added that a humanitarian ceasefire was the only solution to protect all civilians in Gaza.

“I think the only solution we have is a ceasefire because it’s impossible to explain we want to fight against terrorism by killing innocent people,” Macron also said.
Commenting on Macron’s remarks, Netanyahu said that “he made a serious mistake, factually and morally. It is Hamas preventing the evacuation of civilians, not Israel.”
“If we sanctify this method of the terrorists, that they can situate themselves in the middle of the civilian population… then we guarantee that these things will continue to spread,” Netanyahu said, addressing the French president and all other leaders. 
On the same day as Macron’s statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “far too many” Palestinians had died in Israel’s retaliation against Hamas militants in Gaza and noted that Washington was trying to convince West Jerusalem to impose longer “humanitarian pauses,” without giving details.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,180 Palestinians, including 4,609 children. 
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
