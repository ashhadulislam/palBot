“The perfect storm for tragedy: a desperate lack of water; fecal matter strewn across densely packed settlements; unacceptable lack of latrines” – UNICEF 
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has warned that if access to water and sanitation in Gaza continues to be restricted and insufficient, the world “will see a tragic – yet entirely avoidable – surge in the number of children dying.” 
UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said, during a press conference in Geneva on Tuesday: “Let’s be clear: the control of fuel and the access to water is to control whether thousands – perhaps tens of thousands – of children live or die.”
He said the minimum amount of water per person per day – be it in war or famine-like conditions – is 15 liters. That is, to drink, clean, and cook, are all critical to prevent waterborne and other infectious diseases.

“And yet there are parts of Gaza, particularly the north, …where people struggle to access as little as three liters per day. On the same day, none at all.”
He said without enough fuel, “we will see the collapse of sanitation services.”
Elder said this situation creates the perfect storm for the spread of disease.
“The perfect storm for tragedy: a desperate lack of water; fecal matter strewn across densely packed settlements; unacceptable lack of latrines; severe constraints on handwashing, personal hygiene and cleaning.”
The spokesperson said that already they are seeing almost ten times the monthly average of reported cases of diarrhea among children under the age of five, in addition to conditions such as scabies, lice, chicken pox, and respiratory infections. 
Elder said it is urgent that the supply of water and sanitation materials be permitted, including equipment for the emergency repair and operation of critical water and sanitation services.

“Immediately provide safe and unimpeded access to a daily supply of fuel,” he added.
He also said a humanitarian ceasefire is critical, along with safe and unimpeded humanitarian access.
“Without these, an indifferent world will watch the death of countless children in Gaza.”
According to UNICEF, there is, on average, one shower unit for every 700 people at UNRWA shelters in Gaza. And a single toilet for every 150 people.
