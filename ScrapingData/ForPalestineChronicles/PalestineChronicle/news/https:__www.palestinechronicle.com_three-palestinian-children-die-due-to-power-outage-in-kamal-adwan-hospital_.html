More than two-thirds of Gaza’s healthcare facilities – 26 out of 35 hospitals and 52 out of 72 clinics – are out of service.
Three Palestinian children died on Wednesday morning at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip as a result of a power outage resulting from running out of fuel and the inability to operate the oxygen station, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
51 patients, including 4 premature babies, died in the Al-Shifa Medical Complex over the last few days, due to a power outage and the siege Israel imposed on the hospital between November 11 and 18.
More than two-thirds of Gaza’s healthcare facilities – 26 out of 35 hospitals and 52 out of 72 clinics – are out of service, due to damage caused by bombing or lack of fuel. The remaining nine hospitals are partially operating.

The Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital is the only facility currently operating and able to receive patients from the north, under great difficulties.
18 hospitals have been closed and evacuated since the beginning of the Israeli aggression on the Strip, including three hospitals in the past five days: Al-Nasr, Al-Rantisi, and Al-Quds.
Last Sunday, 31 premature babies were evacuated from the Al-Shifa Complex in Gaza City and transported to the Emirates Crescent Hospital in Rafah, under the coordination of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 14,128 Palestinians, including 5,840 children and 3,920 women. More than 31,000 Palestinians were wounded.
