Though Israel’s killing campaign in Gaza continues for the 39th day uninterrupted, Palestinians in the Strip are dying in other ways as well: premature babies at hospitals, cancer patients, among others. 
While The Washington Post reported that a ceasefire is impending, whole families perished in Khan Yunis and other parts of the besieged Strip.
The Israeli army has reportedly stormed the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, after placing the Strip’s largest medical center under siege for over five days.
