Two Lebanese journalists and a civilian were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Tayr Harfa, in southern Lebanon, Al-Mayadeen news network reported. 
Al-Mayadeen correspondent, Farah Omar, and cameraman Rabih Al-Me’mari were murdered early on Tuesday when an Israeli warplane fired two rockets on their location. 
Omar and Al-Me’mari had just ended a live broadcast at 10 am, giving updates on the latest Israeli bombardment in South Lebanon. They were targeted soon after they wrapped up their coverage and went off air.
This is not the first time Israel has targeted Lebanese journalists.

A few days after the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation Israel bombed a crew in southern Lebanon, killing Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah, and three more journalists.
On November 13, Israel renewed its strikes on media crews in the Lebanese town of Yaroun, near the border. The attack did not result in any injuries.
“The intentional killing of our beloved colleagues Farah and Rabih comes after the Israeli war cabinet approved on November 13 regulations that would allow the occupation government to ban and shut down Al-Mayadeen Media Network,” Al-Mayadeen reported. 
Since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza, on October 7, the Lebanese Resistance movement Hezbollah has engaged directly, but relatively in a limited way in the war against the Israeli occupation.
Hezbollah targeted numerous military bases, intelligence installations, and other Israeli positions across the Lebanon-Israel border.

Israel has occupied parts of Lebanon for decades and has only left the country in 2000, following stiff Lebanese resistance under Hezbollah’s leadership. 
It attempted to re-occupy Lebanon in 2006 but failed in what Lebanon considers a major victory against Israel. 
Israel, however, continues to occupy parts of Lebanon, namely the Sheeba Farms region.
Hezbollah has vowed to recover every inch of Lebanon that has been occupied by Israel contrary to international law.
