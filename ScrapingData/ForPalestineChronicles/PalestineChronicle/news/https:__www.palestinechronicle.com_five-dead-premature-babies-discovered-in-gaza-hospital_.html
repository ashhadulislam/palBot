Earlier in November, the Israeli army forced families to evacuate Al Nasr Hospital, leaving behind their premature babies in the intensive care unit.
The decomposing bodies of five premature Palestinian babies were reportedly found in Al-Nasr Hospital on Monday, as reporters and aid workers entered the bombed-out health facility, Al-Jazeera reported.
According to Al-Jazeera, a reporter from Emirati TV channel Al-Mashhad entered Al-Nasr Children’s Hospital on the fourth day of the truce between the Palestinian Resistance and Israel, and discovered the decomposing remains of the babies.

The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor confirmed that it documented the discovery of bodies and in a state of decomposition in the nursery of Al-Nasr Hospital after the premature babies were left to their fate three weeks ago, in what “may amount to a horrific execution and a crime against humanity.”
The Geneva-based rights group called for the formation of an independent international committee to investigate into the incident.
The director of the hospital, Dr. Mustafa Al-Kahlot, said in a statement to the Euro-Med Monitor that he sent an appeal to international organizations, including the Red Cross, in an attempt to save the babies’ lives, but did not receive any response.
