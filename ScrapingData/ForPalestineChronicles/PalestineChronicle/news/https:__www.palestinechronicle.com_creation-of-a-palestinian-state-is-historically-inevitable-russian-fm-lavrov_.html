The creation of a Palestinian state is historically inevitable, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with RT on Wednesday.
“The creation of a Palestinian state is historically inevitable,” Lavrov stated, noting that most current discussions on the future of the Gaza Strip “do not pay due attention” to this fact.
Lavrov stressed that the ceasefire and the adoption of measures to resolve humanitarian problems are the priorities now in Gaza.
“The immediate and most urgent task is the cessation of hostilities and the taking measures to resolve humanitarian problems, which are observed everywhere,” he said.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,500 Palestinians, including 4,710 children.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
