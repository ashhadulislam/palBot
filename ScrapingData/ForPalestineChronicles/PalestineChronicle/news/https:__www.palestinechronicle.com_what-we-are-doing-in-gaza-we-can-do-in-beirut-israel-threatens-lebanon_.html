Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has threatened the Lebanese Resistance Movement Hezbollah, warning that it would be the Lebanese citizens who would pay the price in an escalation of the conflict, Israeli media reported.
Speaking during a visit to the troops in northern Israel on Saturday, Gallant said that Hezbollah is “close to making a grave mistake,” according to The Times of Israel. 
“Hezbollah is dragging Lebanon into a war that may happen, and it is making mistakes,” Gallant said. “

If it makes mistakes of this kind, the ones who will pay the price are first of all the citizens of Lebanon. What we are doing in Gaza we know how to do in Beirut,” the minister added.
Since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza, on October 7, Hezbollah has engaged directly, but relatively in a limited way in the war against the Israeli occupation.
According to Hezbollah sources, the movement has killed and wounded many Israeli soldiers, while targeting numerous military bases, intelligence installations, and other Israeli positions across the Lebanon-Israel border.

Israel has occupied parts of Lebanon for decades and has only left the country in 2000, following stiff Lebanese resistance under Hezbollah’s leadership. 
It attempted to re-occupy Lebanon in 2006 but failed in what Lebanon considers a major victory against Israel.
