Ahmad Jibril, the director of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Nablus City, stated that Israeli forces obstructed ambulances’ access to the injured.
Moreover, eyewitnesses informed Anadolu that the occupying forces conducted home raids in both the camp and the nearby towns, detaining nine Palestinians.
Among those detained were siblings and their cousin, a man and his son from the camp, and three others detained from a bakery in the city.
The Balata refugee camp is considered the biggest refugee camp in the occupied West Bank with 16,000 Palestinians living there.
As technical details related to the ceasefire deal are being finalized, Israel carried out several new massacres, targeting civilian areas in both north and south of the Gaza Strip, killing and wounding many.https://t.co/c9mb3CrF48 pic.twitter.com/OTWYdgWMrC

The camp is located in the east of Nablus city and has been regularly attacked by Israeli forces due to the presence of some Palestinian resistance groups.
While the Israeli army heavily bombards the blockaded Gaza Strip, raids are also being carried out in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem, resulting in the detention of Palestinians.
More than 220 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli forces in the West Bank since October 7, in addition to over 2,800 others who were injured, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.
