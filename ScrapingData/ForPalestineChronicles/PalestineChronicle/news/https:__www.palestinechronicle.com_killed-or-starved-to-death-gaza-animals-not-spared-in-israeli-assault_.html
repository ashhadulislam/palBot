The Israeli onslaught on the besieged Gaza Strip has spared nothing, not even the animals at the Gaza Zoo.
Footage from an Al Jazeera report showed what was left of the zoo when keepers returned during the ceasefire. They were forced to abandon it when the airstrikes began after October 7.
The zoo, reportedly part of the Al Bisan recreational park in Jabalya, was home to around 100 species.
Rifaat Al Arair, a Gaza municipality volunteer, said in the report that “90% of animals did not survive here.” They were either killed in the bombings or starved to death.
“The hyenas are dead, the wolves are dead…these are three Palestinian foxes, they are also dead. They are very rare types of foxes,” he said as he is seen pointing out the corpses lying in the cages.

He also pointed out a single wolf that was running back and forth inside its cage.
“It is clearly terrified, petrified. It hasn’t stopped going to and fro. All the animals around it are dead.”
A lonely lion had survived the Israeli assault, but “it hasn’t eaten in three weeks,” said Al Arair, in the report.
Yahya Al Sarraj, Head of Gaza Municipality, told Al Jazeera that at least two appeals were made “to the international community, and to the Red Cross and the UN, but unfortunately, the Israeli forces did not allow us to reach the place (the zoo).”
He said, “in one case when two brave men of our staff tried to reach the zoo, they had been targeted directly and one of them was injured.”
Before October 7, the zoo was already struggling due to the Israeli siege on the Gaza Strip, according to the report.
