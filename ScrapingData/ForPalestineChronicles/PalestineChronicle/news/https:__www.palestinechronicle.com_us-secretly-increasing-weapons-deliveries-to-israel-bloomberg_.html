The US Department of Defense has reportedly ramped up weapons deliveries to Israel without making any public announcement.
The United States Department of Defense has boosted weapons deliveries to Israel without making any public announcements of the move, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
According to the New York-based news website, deliveries of artillery shells, which supposedly feature prominently on Israel’s wish list, continue despite protests by dozens of relief organizations.
The US has for decades been Israel’s closest ally and a major weapons supplier. Following Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7, Washington quickly came to Israel’s rescue, providing it with Iron Dome air defense missiles and smart bombs.

Citing an internal Defense Department list dated late October, Bloomberg reported that the Pentagon had been dipping into its stocks at home and in Europe to furnish Israel with 36,000 rounds of 30mm cannon ammunition and approximately 2,000 Hellfire Laser Guided missiles for the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter.
The list also included 57,000 155mm High Explosive artillery shells, as well as mortars, rifles, and night vision devices, among other items. Israel reportedly also requested 200 armor-piercing Switchblade 600 strike drones, which the US military does not have in its inventory.
When asked for comment, the US Defense Department said in a statement that it was “leveraging several avenues — from internal stocks to US industry channels – to ensure Israel has the means to defend itself.” Officials added that “this security assistance continues to arrive on a near-daily basis.”
The reported deliveries have apparently continued despite the Biden administration publicly calling on Israel to exercise restraint and avoid civilian casualties during its ongoing war on Gaza.
On Monday, thirty relief groups sent a letter to US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, urging him to halt the deliveries of 155mm shells in particular. They argued that since Gaza is “one of the world’s most densely populated places, 155mm artillery shells are inherently indiscriminate.”

On Tuesday, the US House of Representatives approved a bill proposed by Speaker Mike Johnson over the weekend to avoid a looming government shutdown this Friday.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,500 Palestinians, including 4,710 children.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
