Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters rallied outside US President Joe Biden’s residence in Delaware on Saturday, denouncing Washington’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza, RT reported.
Palestinian flags were seen flying as the crowd chanted “Ceasefire now” and “President Biden, you can’t hide! We charge you with genocide!”

The protest occurred as Biden was delivering a speech at Arlington National Ceremony to mark Veterans Day. 
“War and conflict, death and loss, are not relics of our American history – they’re part of our American story,” Biden said in his address.
The Biden administration has faced increasing criticism over its stance on the war. 
Several pro-Palestinian demonstrations have taken place close to the White House in recent weeks, with one entrance near the West Wing recently covered with blood-red handprints and graffiti that read ‘Genocide Joe’.

Despite reports that the White House is helping to negotiate brief daily pauses in the fighting in Gaza to allow civilians to evacuate, Biden has repeatedly expressed full support for Israel’s right to defend itself. 
On Thursday, he once again said that there is “no possibility” of a full-scale ceasefire until Israel destroys Hamas.
Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,100 – including more than 8,000 children and women. 
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
