Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in cities across Europe against Israel’s onslaught on the Gaza Strip, demanding a permanent ceasefire.
These protests took place as a temporary four-day ceasefire came into effect on Friday, in the besieged enclave.
On Saturday, thousands marched from Hyde Park to Parliament Square in London, chanting “Free Palestine” and “From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Free.”
