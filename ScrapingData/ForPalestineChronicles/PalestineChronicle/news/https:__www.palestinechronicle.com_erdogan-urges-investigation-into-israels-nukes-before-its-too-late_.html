Türkiye will ask international inspectors to determine whether Israel has nuclear weapons, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Saturday. 
Speaking to reporters on his flight home from Germany, the Turkish leader noted that Israel is among the few countries that are not parties to the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
Erdogan said Ankara would ask the International Atomic Energy Agency to investigate whether the Jewish state has a nuclear arsenal.

“Moving forward with this is very important in terms of balancing strategic interests in the region. We will continue to put pressure (on Israel),” Erdogan said. 
“Israel’s nuclear weapons must be inspected beyond any doubt before it is too late. We will follow this through. I also call on the international community not to let this go.” 
Although experts widely believe that Israel maintains a nuclear weapons program, the country does not confirm or deny its existence.
Israeli Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahu caused outrage on November 5 when he floated the idea of dropping a “nuclear bomb” on Gaza.
