At least 12 people were killed and scores injured in Israeli shelling of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.
In a statement, the ministry warned that the lives of thousands of patients, medical personnel and displaced people “are at the risk of death as a result of the direct and repeated bombardment of the Indonesian Hospital.”
According to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, there are 150 patients, 100 medical staff and thousands of displaced people inside the facility.

After destroying the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza City and putting it totally out of service, the Israeli forces surrounded at dawn on Monday the Indonesian Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, targeting it with artillery shelling.  
This led to the death of at least 12 wounded people who were receiving treatment. 
Two doctors were also reportedly wounded.
Medical sources said that the occupation artillery targeted the second floor of the hospital.
The Indonesian hospital is the only one that receives Palestinians wounded by Israel’s airstrikes in the northern Gaza Strip.

According to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, there are 150 patients, 100 medical staff and thousands of displaced people inside the facility.
The Israeli occupation forces are currently besieging the hospital with dozens of armored military vehicles in an area of less than one square kilometer.
Moreover, Israeli snipers are deployed on the roofs of buildings near the hospital.
Ambulance crews are therefore prevented from transporting the wounded to the Indonesian hospital, which is the only partially operational healthcare facility in the northern Gaza Strip.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 13,000 Palestinians, including over 5,500 children and over 3,500 women.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
