Palestinian journalists have appealed for assistance for them to continue “to stand between the truth and a total media blackout” in the besieged Gaza Strip.
The President of the Palestinian Journalist Syndicate (PJS), Nasser Abu Baker, made the plea through the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) on Monday. He was speaking on behalf of journalists based in Jerusalem, Gaza, the West Bank and the diaspora.

Abu Baker said that “for over 40 days now, we have been on the forefront of telling the world the story, and sadly, many have also become the story.”
He said 36 journalists have been killed “by Israeli bombs and bullets”, as well as 12 support media workers, since October 7.
“On average, that is one journalist every single day”, he added.  
Abu Baker said two journalists were unaccounted for and a further 37 were wounded, six seriously.

He said Israel has admitted to destroying the communications systems in Gaza ahead of its intense bombing campaign. 
“Israel does not want the world to see their war crimes, which means that Palestinian journalists who report in real-time on what is going on are a threat to their military campaign, to their impunity.”
The homes of journalists have also been targeted in the airstrikes.  
Abu Baker mentioned Wael Al Dahdouh, an Al Jazeera journalist, whose wife and children were killed in an Israeli airstrike while he was on duty.  
“Today more than 1,000 of your colleagues have been uprooted and are homeless with no roof over their heads. We are in desperate need of humanitarian aid and an end to the siege and occupation.” 
He said journalists urgently require protective gear and safety equipment for them to continue to report on the situation on the ground.  
“Now more than ever, we need your help. We cannot let the world look away as these atrocities continue,” he stressed.

The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave. Several hospitals, mosques, churches and schools have also been destroyed.  
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 13,300 Palestinians, including 5,600 children and 3,550 women. More than 31,000 Palestinians were wounded.
