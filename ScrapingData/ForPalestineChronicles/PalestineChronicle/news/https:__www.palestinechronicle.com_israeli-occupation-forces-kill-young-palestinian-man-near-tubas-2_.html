Earlier on Thursday, Israeli forces opened fire on Bani Odeh, preventing ambulance teams from approaching and providing medical assistance. The young man was later announced dead of his wounds.
Simultaneously, Israeli occupation forces closed the military checkpoints of Tayasir and Al-Hamra, both located in the vicinity of the deadly incident, in both directions, severely impacting the movement of Palestinian civilians and leading to a traffic jam.
