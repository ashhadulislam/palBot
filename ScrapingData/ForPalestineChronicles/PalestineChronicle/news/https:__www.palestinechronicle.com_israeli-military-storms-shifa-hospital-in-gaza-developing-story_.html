The Israeli army has stormed the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, after placing the Strip’s largest medical center under siege for over five days. 
This is what we know.
GAZA HEALTH SOURCES (Cited by Al-Jazeera): Israeli army tanks have entered the grounds of the Al-Shifa medical center in Gaza City.
CNN (Citing Israeli miliary source): Israel army said it is carrying out a “precise and targeted operation” in Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. This comes as Israel officials have repeatedly alleged Hamas is storing weapons and operating a ‘command center’ from the hospital, a claim the White House backed on Tuesday and Palestinian hospital officials and Hamas have rejected.
GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY: Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for the Ministry of Health in Gaza said that there is nothing that calls for shooting inside the Al-Shifa Hospital because there is no form of Palestinian Resistance in it, and what the Israeli occupation is doing constitutes a form of terrorism aimed at doctors and patients.
