Israeli tanks reportedly opened fire in northern and southern Gaza, in violation of the terms of the Gaza truce.
Israeli occupation forces violated the ceasefire on Tuesday morning by firing artillery shots in northern Gaza, particularly in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood, and in southern Gaza, east of the cities of Rafah and Khan Yunis. 
Al-Mayadeen correspondent in Gaza confirmed that Israeli occupation forces fired artillery and smoke shells west of the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood during their withdrawal, aiming to cover their retreat from the central part of the neighborhood towards Rashid Street.
Moreover, smoke rounds were fired at civilian residential buildings in Al-Shati Refugee Camp, north of Gaza, Al-Mayadeen reported.
Israel is facing an existential threat. But this threat does not come from Hamas, Iran or Hizbollah, but from somewhere else entirely. #Gaza #Palestine #Israel #middleeast #iran #lebanon pic.twitter.com/o4ASMtbEQD
