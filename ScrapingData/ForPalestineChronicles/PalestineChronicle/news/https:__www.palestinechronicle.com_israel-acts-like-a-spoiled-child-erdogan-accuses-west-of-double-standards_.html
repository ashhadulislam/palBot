Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President of Turkiye, has accused Western nations of double standards, while Israel acts like a “spoiled child.”
Speaking at a joint Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh on Saturday, Erdogan said “It is a shame that Western countries, always a voice for human rights and freedoms, remain silent on the massacre in Palestine.”
“We are faced with unprecedented barbarism in history, where hospitals, schools, and refugee camps are bombed and civilians are massacred.”
The emergency summit was jointly organized by the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to discuss the Israeli onslaught on the Gaza Strip and West Bank.

He said Western countries are “not even making a call for a ceasefire.”
The Turkish president referred to the Charlie Hebdo incident where “close to 20 people were killed, and the heads of government and state walked together in Paris. But close to 12,000 people are killed in Gaza, and none of them are taking action. This is not only weakness but also cowardice and lack of conscience.”
He added that “the Israeli government is acting like the spoiled child of the West, and it has to compensate for the damages that it causes.”
Erdogan further proposed the establishment of an OIC fund to facilitate the rebuilding and construction of Gaza, saying Türkiye is ready to offer comprehensive support.
GAZA GOVERNMENT MEDIA OFFICE: The number of Palestinians killed in Gaza since October 7 has risen to 11,180, including 4,609 children.

He highlighted the importance of supplying fuel to Gaza, particularly hospitals, and reportedly said that Türkiye would provide ten flights of essential supplies to El Arish airport in Egypt to be dispatched to Gaza. 
Erdogan expressed deep concern about the status of the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem.
“Jerusalem is our redline,” he said, reportedly adding that it is also crucial for the entire region’s peace and stability.
