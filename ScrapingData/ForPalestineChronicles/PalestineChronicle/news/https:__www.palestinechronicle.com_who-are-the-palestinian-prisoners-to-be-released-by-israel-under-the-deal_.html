The Israeli Ministry of Justice released on Wednesday morning the list of Palestinian prisoners included in the deal with the Palestinian Resistance. Here are some of the names.
The Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli government have agreed to a four-day truce that will see the release of 50 women and children held in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons.
The deal was announced on Wednesday and the starting time is expected to be confirmed in the next 24 hours, according to a statement from Qatar, which mediated the agreement.
The next few hours are crucial to the success of the ceasefire. News reports speak of intense Israeli bombardment of various residential targets in central Gaza. Many bodies are also being pulled from the rubble of destroyed homes.https://t.co/aoNLznDjzG pic.twitter.com/kNDSa2xBff

According to Israeli media, the Israeli Ministry of Justice released on Wednesday morning the list of Palestinian prisoners included in the deal, giving the Israeli public 24 hours to appeal to the court.
“The list published includes twice as many names – 300 – based on the possibility that Hamas will be able to locate more Israeli hostages and release them in return for more prisoners,” the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.
Haaretz explained that the list includes 123 Palestinian children currently held in Israeli prisons. 
The Israeli newspaper also lists some female prisoners who are set to be released, including Maysoun Musa Al-Jabali, arrested in 2015; Marah Bakeer, arrested in 2015 at the age of 15; Israa Jabris, who suffered burns and was charged with attempted murder after her car exploded near an Israeli checkpoint in 2015. 
The list also includes 59-year-old Hanan Abdullah Barghouthi and 53-year-old Samira Abd Al-Aziz Harbawi.
According to the Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association Addammer, there are currently 7,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, including 2,070 administrative detainees, 200 children, and 62 women.
