Later, the Israeli occupation army declared the Tulkarm camp and its surrounding areas military zones and declared a curfew there, especially Hanoun Square, Al-Rabay’ah, and Al-Balawneh.
Israeli army vehicles were stationed at the entrances to the camp as two bulldozers broke their way into the area, while violent confrontations took place.
An Israeli drone reportedly bombed with two missiles a house in Al-Balawneh neighborhood in the Tulkarm camp.
Meanwhile, the occupation forces imposed a siege on the Thabet Thabet Governmental Hospital in the city of Tulkarm, which obstructed ambulances from transferring the injured to receive treatment.
Eyewitnesses also reported that the Israeli army chased the ambulances, obstructed their work, and prevented them from moving freely.
The Israeli aggression against the city and camp of Tulkarm caused great destruction to the streets, infrastructure, and citizens’ property.
