The Ministry of Health in Gaza announced the “suspension of coordination with the World Health Organization regarding the process of evacuating patients and medical personnel from hospitals in the Gaza Strip following the detention of employees working in the medical sector by the Israeli occupation army.”
In turn, the WHO confirmed that “we do not have information about the well-being of the four remaining health staff, including the director of Al-Shifa hospital,” in reference to four of the six staff members arrested at Al-Shifa.
WHO called for “their legal and human rights to be fully observed during their detention.”
The organization had said in a statement received by Quds Press last Saturday that, “the director of the biggest hospital in the besieged Palestinian territory had been arrested on Wednesday along with five other health workers, while they were taking part in a United Nations mission to evacuate patients.”
111 Palestinians were buried today in a mass grave in Khan Yunis, after they were detained by the Israeli occupation forces in Al-Shifa Medical Complex and Beit Hanoun Hospital a few days ago.

The Geneva-based Euro-Med Rights posted on X: “We are immensely concerned by reports that @WHO may have unwittingly or knowingly facilitated Israel’s kidnapping of senior medical staff from al-Shifa. WHO promised staff & patients a safe evacuation to the South coordinated with Israel, IDF stopped the convoy & kidnapped some.”
On November 18, the invading Israeli military forced most of the patients, wounded, and medical staff out of the medical complex, demanding they walk on foot to the south of the Gaza Strip. 31 premature babies were also evacuated.
Israeli forces intensified their attacks on Palestinian hospitals in the besieged and war-torn Gaza Strip in the week that preceded the temporary ceasefire agreement.
Until the ceasefire was announced on Friday, November 24, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza announced that over 15,000 Palestinians, including over 6,150 children and more than 4,000, with another 36,000 wounded.
