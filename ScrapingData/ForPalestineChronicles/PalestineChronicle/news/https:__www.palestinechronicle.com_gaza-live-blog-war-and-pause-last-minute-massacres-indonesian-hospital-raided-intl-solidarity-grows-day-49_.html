At 7 am sharp Gaza time, a four-day humanitarian truce kicked in. Aside from the sound of an Israeli shell east of Khan Yunis and the brief sounding of sirens in the Israel-Gaza border area, the truce seemed to be holding.
Until the last minute, however, Israel continued to kill Palestinians, from Khan Yunis to Nuseirat to the Indonesian Hospital.
Hundreds of thousands of people rushed to the streets to check on their homes and ravaged lives, yet still praising the Resistance.
When the whole world has failed them, only the Resistance fought for them.
