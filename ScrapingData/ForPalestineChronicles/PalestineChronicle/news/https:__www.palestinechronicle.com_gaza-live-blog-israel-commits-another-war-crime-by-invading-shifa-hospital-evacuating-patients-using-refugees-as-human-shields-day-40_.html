Israel has turned the al Shifa medical complex in Gaza into a military base when it invaded the hospital before dawn, ordering patients to evacuate and strip-searching young patients.
The invasion followed days of relentless Israeli propaganda accusing the Hamas leadership of hiding in tunnels underneath the hospital. However, no such evidence that the hospital has been used for military purposes has been produced.
Meanwhile, Israel continued to bombard various parts of the Gaza Strip, killing and wounding many.
