Nofooth Hammad, 16, was supposed to be released from Israeli prisons on Friday, but she has never arrived home.
One of the Palestinian child detainees who were supposed to be released on Friday as part of the truce agreement deal between the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli government has never arrived home, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
Nofooth Hammad, a 16-year-old Jerusalemite detainee, was supposed to be among those released from Israeli prisons on Friday, but her family has not heard from her since.

On Monday, the Wadi Hilweh Information Center’s lawyer, Firas Al-Jabrini, said they were able to track down her whereabouts but that Israeli authorities prevented the family from seeing her.
Al-Jabrini affirmed that Nofooth was taken to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Israel for medical treatment after being attacked and beaten by Israeli soldiers.
The lawyer added that he, along with her father, went to check on her at Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital but was prevented from seeing her.
Nofooth was detained by Israeli occupation forces in December 2021, when she was only 14, and sentenced to 12 years in prison.
