The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas confirmed on Wednesday at dawn, that a 4-day humanitarian truce mediated through Qatari and Egyptian efforts has been achieved.
Update: Al-Jazeera Arabic news channel reported that the agreement is scheduled to start on Thursday. 
According to the Palestinian movement, Al-Jazeera reported that the agreement entails the following:
“50 Israeli hostages, women and children, will be released in exchange for the release of 150 women and children of our people in the prisons of the occupation.
“Under the agreement, hundreds of trucks of humanitarian, relief and medical aid and fuel will be brought to all areas of the Gaza Strip.
“Under the agreement, the movement of Israeli military vehicles in the Gaza Strip will also be suspended.
“According to the agreement, a ceasefire will be established by both sides and the cessation of all military actions of the occupation army in all areas of the Gaza Strip.
“Under the agreement, the free movement of people from north to south along Salah al-Din Street is guaranteed.
During the period of the truce, the occupation carries out no attack or arrest of anyone in all areas of the Gaza Strip.
“Under the agreement, air traffic in the south will be suspended for the duration of the truce days and in the north for 6 hours a day.
“As we announce the conclusion of the truce agreement, we affirm that our hands will remain on the trigger and our battalions will remain on the lookout to defend our people.
“The Resistance managed the negotiations from a position of steadfastness and strength on the ground despite the attempts of the occupation to prolong them.
“The terms of the agreement were formulated in accordance with the vision of the Resistance, which aim to serve our people and strengthen their steadfastness in the face of aggression.”
Earlier, the Israeli government ratified the deal to exchange prisoners and detainees in Gaza with Hamas and the establishment of a temporary truce in the Strip, according to an official statement.
The announcement came at the end of a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where all but three far-right ministers affiliated with the Religious Zionist Party supported the deal.
The Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, had announced that it was holding 200 prisoners of about 250 Israelis in total captured by the Palestinian Resistance factions in the Al-Aqsa Flood operation on October 7.
Al-Qassam also announced earlier that the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip has caused the loss of more than 60 Israeli prisoners in the Strip since the start of the war.
