The corruption trial against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to resume on Monday, after the expiration of the emergency wartime suspension of proceedings, Israeli media reported.
According to the Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post, “the trial was scheduled to continue through October, but was stalled after October 7”.
However, “as the courts returned regular activity in December, Netanyahu’s trial continues despite the war,” the newspaper added.
As Israel's war against Hamas continues, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial will resume on Monday.

The Jerusalem Post reported that Monday’s court session will begin “with testimony from Detective Eran Buchnik from Lahav 433, who investigated Netanyahu corruption case. Following Buchnik, the court is to hear testimony from Detective Dotan Malichi and Israel Securities Authority investigator Lior Shpitz.”
For its part, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted Likud member David Amsalem as calling this decision a ‘disgrace.”
“War? Hostages? Evacuees? The economy? No and no… What’s most important now is to engage the prime minister of Israel with the unfounded allegations and delusional trifles,” Amsalem reportedly wrote on X. “Yes, yes, you read it right. There’s no reason to delay it. It’s an unparalleled disgrace!”
Netanyahu stands accused of fraud, breach of trust, and accepting bribes in three separate cases involving powerful media moguls and wealthy associates.
