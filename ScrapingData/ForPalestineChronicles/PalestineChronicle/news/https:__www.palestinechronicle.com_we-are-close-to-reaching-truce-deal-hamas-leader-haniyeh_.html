Al-Risheq said that “the release of Israeli prisoners will be matched by the release of Palestinian prisoners from occupation prisons.”
Hamas’ top official added that before delivering the response regarding the truce proposal and its terms, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh met with the Islamic Jihad group’s leader Ziyad al-Nakhalah. 
The ceasefire would arrive at a critical time for Gazans, as the World Food Program announced that 2.2 million of all people in the Strip – nearly the total population of the small region – are in urgent need of food assistance.
