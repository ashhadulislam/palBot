Since there is no safe place in Gaza, as international aid organizations have repeatedly warned, hospitals have become a site of major Israeli massacres.
The Israeli occupation army arrested the director of Al-Shifa Medical Complex, Dr. Muhammad Abu Salamiya, and a number of medical personnel in Gaza, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation announced. 
Khaled Abu Samra, a doctor at Al-Shifa Hospital, confirmed to Agence France-Presse that Israeli occupation forces arrested Abu Salamiya and other members of the medical staff at dawn on Thursday.
On November 18, the invading Israeli military forced most of the patients, wounded, and medical staff out of the medical complex, demanding they walk on foot to the south of the Gaza Strip. 31 premature babies were also evacuated.

However, at least 180 patients remain in Al-Shifa, along with three doctors and four nurses, according to medical sources from inside the hospital. 
Israeli forces have intensified their attacks on Palestinian hospitals in the besieged and war-torn Gaza Strip. 
Hospitals and medical centers in Gaza host patients and thousands of people who had fled there in the early days of war, seeking safety.
But since there is no safe place in Gaza, as international aid organizations have repeatedly warned, hospitals became a site of major Israeli massacres, starting with the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital on October 17, followed by the Rantisi Hospital, the European, the Indonesian, the Al-Shifa, and many others.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 14,532 Palestinians, including nearly 6,000 children. 7,000 Palestinians are missing, including more than 4,700 women and children.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
