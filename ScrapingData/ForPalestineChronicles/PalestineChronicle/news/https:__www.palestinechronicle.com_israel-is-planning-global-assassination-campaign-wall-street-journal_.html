While such operations are usually planned in secret, the Israeli government has explicitly warned that it intends to kill Hamas operatives outside of Gaza. 
Israeli spies are preparing to assassinate Hamas leaders living in Lebanon, Türkiye, and Qatar once the aggression on Gaza is over, anonymous officials have told the Wall Street Journal. 
The operation was reportedly planned more than a month ago but postponed so that hostage negotiations could take place.
The Israeli intelligence services began drawing up plans for the assassination campaign after Hamas’ October 7 attack on the Jewish state, the American newspaper reported on Thursday, citing the anonymous officials. 
Some reportedly wanted to embark on the campaign immediately but were ordered to wait so that negotiations to free the captives held by the Palestinian Resistance movement Hamas could progress.
The killings have been authorized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the officials said.
While such operations are usually planned in secret, the Israeli government has explicitly warned that it intends to kill Hamas operatives outside of Gaza. 
Before the officials leaked the story to the Wall Street Journal, Netanyahu declared last month that he had “instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas wherever they are.”
Israel’s Mossad has a long history of assassinations on foreign soil, some of which have escalated into major diplomatic incidents.
In 1997, Netanyahu ordered Mossad to assassinate Hamas co-founder Khaled Mashal in Jordan. 
The two-man assassination team was captured after one sprayed a toxin into Mashal’s ear, and Jordan threatened to shred its peace treaty with Israel in response. 
The diplomatic standoff was defused when Israeli agents delivered an antidote to the toxin and Netanyahu agreed to release dozens of Palestinian prisoners, including Hamas imam and co-founder Ahmed Yassin.
