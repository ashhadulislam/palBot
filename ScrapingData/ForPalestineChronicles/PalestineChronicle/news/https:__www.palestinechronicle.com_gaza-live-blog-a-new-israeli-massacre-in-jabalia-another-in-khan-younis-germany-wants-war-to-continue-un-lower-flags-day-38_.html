The 38th day of the Israeli war on Gaza began with two massacres, one in Jabalia, and the other in Khan Yunis.
Equally terrifying is the fact that many communities are nearing a state of starvation.
Grocery stores are running out of food, hospitals are running out of medicine and no fuel can be found anywhere.
Meanwhile, intense fighting between the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli military continues at different fronts as another battlefront is rapidly escalating at the Lebanese-Israeli border.
