Israeli Air Force Commander Tomer Bar has stated that Tel Aviv had plans to launch attacks “all over the Middle East”, Israeli media reported.
“The Air Force as the strategic arm of the State of Israel is prepared and operates all over the Middle East and in every required arena,” Bar said in a statement on Thursday, adding: “We are well prepared with operational plans for the northern arena.”
The Israeli military official’s statements came days after the Yemeni armed forces – affiliated with the Houthi Ansar Allah group – announced on Tuesday evening the launch of a batch of ballistic missiles at various Israeli targets, including sensitive targets in the Eilat region.

The military spokesperson for the Houthis, Brigadier General Yahya Saree, confirmed in a statement at the time that they “Launched a batch of ballistic missiles at various targets in the occupied Palestinian territories, including sensitive targets in the Umm Al-Rashrash area (Eilat)”.
This came, according to Saree, “only 24 hours after another military operation was carried out by (Yemeni) armed forces with drones aimed at the same targets.”
Saree confirmed that Yemeni forces, as part of their military operations against Israel, have begun taking all practical measures to deal with any Israeli ship in the Red Sea appropriately.
Saree also stressed that the operations by the Yemeni armed forces against Israel will not stop until Tel Aviv stops targeting Gaza.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 12,000 Palestinians, including 5,000 children and over 3,000 women.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
