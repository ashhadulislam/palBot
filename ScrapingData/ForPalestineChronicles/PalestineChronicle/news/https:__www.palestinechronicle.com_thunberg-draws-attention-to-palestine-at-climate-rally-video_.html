Addressing tens of thousands at the Climate Crisis Coalition Thunberg said that as a climate justice movement, “we have to listen to the voices of those who are being oppressed and those who are fighting for freedom and justice.” 
Climate change activist Greta Thunberg welcomed pro-Palestine campaigners at Amsterdam’s largest-ever environmental march on Sunday, before giving some of her allotted speaking time to a Palestinian woman as well as Afghan activist Sahar Shizad.
Addressing tens of thousands at the Climate Crisis Coalition Thunberg said that as a climate justice movement, “we have to listen to the voices of those who are being oppressed and those who are fighting for freedom and justice. Otherwise, there can be no climate justice without international solidarity.” 
After the women spoke, Thunberg resumed her speech but was interrupted by another environmental protester who came onto the stage and told her: “I have come here for a climate demonstration, not a political view,” before he was ushered off the stage.

Thunberg was unperturbed and joined members of the audience who began chanting “No climate justice on occupied land.”
The unidentified man was wearing a jacket bearing the insignia of the Dutch political party Water Natuurlijk which has elected members in Dutch water boards.
The women had reportedly been part of a small group who briefly chanted pro-Palestinian slogans and waved flags near the front of the crowd before Thunberg began speaking.
More than 70,000 people took part in the demonstration, which was also intended to bring attention to racism, poverty, and the housing shortage facing the Netherlands.
The Climate Crisis Coalition is made up of several organizations such as Oxfam Novib, Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion, Fossil Free NL, and Thunberg’s group Fridays for Future.
