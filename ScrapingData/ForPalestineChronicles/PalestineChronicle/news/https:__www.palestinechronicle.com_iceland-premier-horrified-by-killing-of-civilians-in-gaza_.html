Iceland’s Prime Minister has said she is “horrified” by the continued killing of civilians in the Gaza Strip and expressed support for a humanitarian ceasefire.
“I’m horrified by the ongoing civilian deaths in Gaza. Iceland condemns all violations of international humanitarian law,” Katrín Jakobsdsóttir posted on X on Wednesday.
“Nothing can take priority over the duty to provide medical services to people in need,” she added.
Jakobsdóttir supported calls for a “humanitarian pause” in the besieged Palestinian enclave last month as well.

“As the 10th Emergency Special Session of the #UNGA convenes today, Iceland joins calls for a humanitarian pause to facilitate the safe delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza. The civilian suffering and loss of life is heartbreaking,” she posted on X on October 26.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,500 Palestinians, including 4,710 children and 3,160 women. The number of wounded has reached 29,800.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
