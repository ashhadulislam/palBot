Israeli occupation forces remained inside the Al-Shifa Medical Complex, west of Gaza City, after storming it for the second time in 24 hours, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
Local sources told WAFA that Israeli bulldozers and tanks raided the medical complex from its western entrance.
The Israeli tanks have been surrounding the Al-Shifa hospital with military tanks for the past week.
On Wednesday night, the Israeli occupation forces had withdrawn from inside Al-Shifa Medical Complex after storming it at dawn.

However, a WAFA correspondent reporting from inside Al-Shifa said that Israeli tanks and snipers remained deployed on the surrounding buildings, in addition to the drones constantly flying overhead.
The correspondent reported that Israeli forces stormed the new surgical building and the emergency building where patients and medical staff were present.
The raids on the hospital departments were carried out gradually and the occupation army blew up the doors between the departments while ordering all those in the medical complex to gather at the center of its eastern courtyard, WAFA correspondent said.

Medical sources said the Israeli army placed facial recognition cameras and electronic gates in the hospital courtyard, forced displaced people to take off their clothes and detained them, while interrogating doctors, patients and displaced people.
In addition, Israeli forces arrested several displaced persons and families of those killed and wounded who were inside the hospital, interrogated and tortured them, and detained them for several hours in the yards. They are also still preventing the administration from burying the dead who remain in the yards.
