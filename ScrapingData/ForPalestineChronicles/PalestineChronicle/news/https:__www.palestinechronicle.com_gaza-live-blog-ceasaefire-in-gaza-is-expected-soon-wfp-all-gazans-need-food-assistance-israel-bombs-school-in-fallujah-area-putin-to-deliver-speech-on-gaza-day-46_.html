A temporary ceasefire in Gaza is expected, following news that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad have informed Qatar and Egypt of their positions on the matter.
The ceasefire would arrive at a critical time for Palestinians in Gaza, as the World Food Program announced that 2.2 million of all people in the Strip – nearly the total population of the small region – are in urgent need of food assistance.
Meanwhile, fierce fighting between Palestinian Resistance and invading Israelis continued in several areas in northern Gaza.
Israeli massacres targeting civilians also continued unabated.
