Ambulance crews reported that they are facing tremendous difficulties in reaching the two schools to evacuate the bodies and injured as a result of the intensive Israeli shelling against the area.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes across various areas of Gaza since Friday morning, as Israel resumed its aggression after a seven-day truce, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.
A four-day truce, which began on Friday, November 24, was extended twice, and collapsed on Friday, December 1, at 7 am local time.
Since October 7, 15,899 Palestinians, including over 6,500 children and more than 4,000 women were killed, with another 41,136 wounded, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
