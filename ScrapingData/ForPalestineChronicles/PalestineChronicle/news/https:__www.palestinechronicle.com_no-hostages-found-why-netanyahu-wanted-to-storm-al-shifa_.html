The Geneva-based right group also stated that “the Israeli army is the only party controlling the scene inside the al-Shifa Medical Complex” as “no third party or international organization was permitted to be present inside, which raises doubts about any Israeli narrative that would be released later.”

The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
