The outlet mocked “comically bad” propaganda stunts, such as the fake Palestinian nurse.
The Israeli government is resorting to “preposterous” and “increasingly wild” disinformation online and appears to have lost control over the narrative about its war on Gaza, the Daily Beast said in an article published on Wednesday.
As one example, author Marc Owen Jones pointed to the November 11 video posted by the Israeli Foreign Ministry’s Arabic-language social media platform X. It showed a “Palestinian nurse” condemning Hamas for taking over the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza.
“Everything about it smacked of high school theater – from the botched accent that sounded like it was straight out of an Israeli soap opera to the perfectly scripted IDF talking points rolling off her tongue,” Jones wrote.
The nurse had a “pristine white lab coat” and “immaculate” makeup, but no one at Al-Shifa had ever seen her before, he added. The video was mocked so much that Israel Arabic deleted it within a day.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,500 Palestinians, including 4,710 children and 3,160 women. The number of wounded has reached 29,800.
According to the Daily Beast, Israeli “desperation is evident in a seemingly unstemmable tide of preposterous claims,” such as the “annotated and pristine copy” of Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf allegedly found in a child’s bedroom in Gaza on November 12.
A day later, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari claimed to be in the basement of al-Rantisi Hospital in Gaza, where he said Hamas had kept some of the 200-plus Israeli hostages.
The key evidence for his claim was a piece of paper with Arabic writing posted on the wall, which he called “a guardian list, where every terrorist writes his name, and every terrorist has his own shift, guarding the people that were here.”
According to Jones, however, the piece of paper wasn’t a list of names but of the days of the week.
