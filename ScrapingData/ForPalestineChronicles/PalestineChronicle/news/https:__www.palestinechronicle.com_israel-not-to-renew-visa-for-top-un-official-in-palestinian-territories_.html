Israeli authorities informed the United Nations that Tel Aviv will not renew the visa of Lynn Hastings, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Palestine, a UN spokesman said on Friday.
“We’ve been informed by the Israeli authorities that they would not renew the visa of Ms Hastings past the due date at some point later this month,” Stephane Dujarric told reporters during a press briefing.
Dujarric added that UN personnel do not overstay their visas in any country, but added that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has “full confidence” in Hastings. He did not clarify whether Hastings, who is currently based in Jerusalem, will be replaced or will continue her work from another base.
GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY: The number of victims of the Israeli aggression since its beginning has risen to 15,207 martyrs. 70% of the victims are children and women. The number of wounded has increased to 40,652.

“I think you’ve seen some very public attacks on Twitter against her which were utterly unacceptable. And you know, personal direct attacks on UN personnel anywhere around the world is unacceptable and puts people’s lives at risks,” Dujarric added.
In late October, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen wrote on X that “Hastings’ dangerous rhetoric endangers innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians,” alleging that Hastings was slow to condemn the October 7 attack on southern Israel by Palestinian Resistance movement Hamas.
Lynn Hastings is a veteran UN official. She has served as the deputy special coordinator for the Middle East peace process and U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory for nearly three years.
