Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that “flames of war” should not be let “re-ignited” in the besieged Gaza Strip, Anadolu News Agency reported on Wednesday.
“China has always firmly stood on the side of peace, human conscience, and international law in the Palestine-Israel conflict,” Wang said during a meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in New York on Tuesday to discuss the humanitarian pause.
The top Chinese diplomat will chair a high-level meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the Palestine question on Wednesday, Anadolu noted, adding that China is the current rotating chair of the Security Council.
“The key issue now lies in whether the temporary ceasefire agreement can be extended,” Wang reportedly said.

Wang highlighted that China’s position is to “never let the flames of war reignite” and that a “comprehensive ceasefire” should be achieved in Gaza.
Regarding the humanitarian support to the besieged Strip, the Chinese foreign minister said it should be allowed to enter Gaza “unimpeded”.
According to Wang, “an effective supervision mechanism should be established”.
Wang also called for “a more authoritative, larger-scale and more effective international peace conference to be convened as soon as possible” to formulate a roadmap for relaunching the “two-state solution.”
