Speaking of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Turkish leader said: “Netanyahu is a goner; we are about to get rid of him. (..) Currently, 60-70% of his own country’s citizens oppose Netanyahu.”
Anadolu quoted Erdogan as saying that Türkiye will continue to stand by the oppressed in Gaza. 
“Israel is attempting to obstruct aid and starve Gaza of food and water. But we do not give up,” he said, adding:
“Regardless of the obstacles, we will continue to keep Gaza alive. The entire world, particularly Islamic countries, should mobilize to provide aid.”
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 12,000 Palestinians, including 5,000 children and over 3,000 women.
