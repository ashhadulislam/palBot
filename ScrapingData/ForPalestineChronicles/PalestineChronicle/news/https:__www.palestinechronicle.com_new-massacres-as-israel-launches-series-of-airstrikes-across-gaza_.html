The tragic death toll continues to mount as Israeli occupation forces intensify their airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, leaving a number of Palestinians dead and many others injured.
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that the northern Gaza Strip is witnessing violent airstrikes by Israeli warplanes.
The shelling targeted several areas in the Jabalia refugee camp, civilian homes in Beit Lahia, the vicinity of residential towers in Gaza’s Sheikh Zayed City, and the vicinity of the Indonesian hospital.
EMERGENCY SUPERVISOR AT AL-SHIFA: Not everyone was able to leave the hospital. The displaced were told to head to Al Wahda Street, and many children and adults were unable to continue walking.
