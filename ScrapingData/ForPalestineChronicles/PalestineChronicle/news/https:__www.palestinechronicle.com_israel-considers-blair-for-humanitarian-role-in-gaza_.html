Israel is considering installing former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair as humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, in an attempt to reduce international pressure over its onslaught on the Gaza Strip. 
 According to Israeli media, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hopes to use Blair’s experience as a former envoy to the region to quell demands for a ceasefire and worldwide concerns over the mounting civilian casualties in the besieged enclave.

After stepping down as leader of the UK, Blair served as envoy to Palestine and Israel for the Middle East quartet, made up of the US, EU, UN and Russia. 
The exact definition, authority, and scope of the proposed role had not yet been clearly defined, according to reports. There may be an emphasis on “providing medical treatment and medicines, and the possibility of evacuating the wounded and sick from the Strip.”

Blair’s office reportedly said that he has had “conversations with people in the region and other places in order to see what can be done” regarding the situation. However, he has not yet “been given or offered a position” by Netanyahu’s office. 
The former prime minister’s appointment as peace envoy for the Quartet in 2007 was highly controversial due to his decision to join the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. 
A third of those who reportedly participated in a UK poll in 2017 – still believe Blair should be tried as a war criminal. This sentiment is shared by Hans Blix, the UN weapons inspector whose findings that Saddam Hussein did not have WMDs were ignored in favor of going to war.
