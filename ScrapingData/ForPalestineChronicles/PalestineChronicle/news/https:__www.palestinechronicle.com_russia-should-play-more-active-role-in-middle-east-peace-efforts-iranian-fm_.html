According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 13,000 Palestinians, including over 5,500 children and over 3,500 women.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
