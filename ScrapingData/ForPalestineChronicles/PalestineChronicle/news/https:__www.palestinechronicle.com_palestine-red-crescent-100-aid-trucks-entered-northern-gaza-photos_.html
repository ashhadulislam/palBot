The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Sunday that 100 aid trucks entered northern regions of the Gaza Strip, the Anadolu news agency reported.
PRCS said in a statement “100 aid trucks were brought into Gaza City and the northern part (of the Strip) by the Palestine Red Crescent today containing food, water, baby milk, and blankets.”
“For the first time, 50 Egyptian aid trucks arrived through the Rafah crossing and headed directly towards Gaza City and the northern side through the (Israeli) barrier that separates the north of the Strip from its south,” the statement added.
Earlier on Sunday, the PRCS announced that it had sent another aid convoy “consisting of 50 trucks from Rafah, in the south of the Gaza Strip, towards Gaza City and its north, loaded with relief and food supplies, drinking water, medicines and emergency supplies.”
The Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli government have agreed to a four-day truce that will see the release of 50 women and children held in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons.
The deal was announced on Wednesday and the starting time is expected to be confirmed in the next 24 hours, according to a statement from Qatar, which mediated the agreement.
Until the ceasefire was announced, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza announced that over 14,854 Palestinians, including nearly 6,150 children, with another 36,000 wounded. 7,000 Palestinians are missing, including more than 4,700 women and children.
