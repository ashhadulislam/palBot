“This slaughter must stop, we reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire and for the release of humanitarian aid into Gaza.”
Following a unanimous vote, the Dublin City Council has agreed to fly the Palestinian flag, the Irish Independent reported. 
The decision is one of many similar acts of solidarity with Gaza, which is currently enduring a genocidal Israeli war that killed and wounded tens of thousands of Palestinians. 
The motion to fly the flag was submitted by several Irish political parties, including the Independent Group, Sinn Féin, Social Democrats, and People Before Profit.

A number of individual councilors have also signed on to the motion, according to the Irish newspaper.
Starting today, and for seven days straight, the Palestinian flag will be proudly displayed on top of the City Hall.
The Irish Independent quoted Councillor Cieran Perry as saying that he was delighted by the decision. 
He said that “over 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the indiscriminate attacks began. More than 6,000 of the victims have been children.”
“This slaughter must stop, we reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire and for the release of humanitarian aid into Gaza,” he added.
“It’s obvious Israel couldn’t care less about the widespread disgust at their indiscriminate slaughter of civilians in Gaza so we have to continue to keep the pressure on the leaders in the countries supporting (Israel)”.
Equally strong messages of solidarity and rebuke of Israeli atrocities in Gaza were issued by other councilors, including Noeleen Reilly, who said that “continuing to drop bombs on innocent men, women and children is unforgivable” and anyone who does not call for an immediate ceasefire in the region “will find themselves on the wrong side of history”.

For his part, the former Lord Mayor councilor Christy Burke was quoted as saying that it is “time for those in power to step up to the plate (as the) voice of ordinary people has been seen and heard worldwide”.
“The Independent Group calls on the American Government to intervene and use their influence with Israel to stop the indiscriminate slaughter of people in Gaza,” he added.
