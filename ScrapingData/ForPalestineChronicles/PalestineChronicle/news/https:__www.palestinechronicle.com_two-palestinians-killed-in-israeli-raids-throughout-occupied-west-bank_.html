In the town of Burqa, Israeli soldiers detained at least four Palestinians.
In the city of Tulkarm, also in the north, Israeli occupation soldiers detained two Palestinians after raiding and searching their homes.

The Israeli raid into Tulkarm sparked confrontations with local residents, with Israeli occupation forces firing live ammunition to disperse the protesters. No injuries were reported.
These arrests are part of an ongoing Israeli mass detention campaign in the occupied West Bank coinciding with the Israeli aggression on Gaza.
According to right groups, over 3,000 Palestinians have been detained by the Israeli occupation army across the occupied West Bank since October 7.
