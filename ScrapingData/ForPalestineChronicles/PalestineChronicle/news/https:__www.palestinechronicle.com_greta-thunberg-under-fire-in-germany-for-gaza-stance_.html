Environmental activist Greta Thunberg has come under fire in Germany over her pro-Palestinian stance.
Environmental activist Greta Thunberg has come under fire in Germany over her pro-Palestinian stance, where the local chapter of the climate movement Fridays for Future has reportedly distanced itself from her views.
This comes two days after Thunberg chanted “no climate justice on occupied land” at a climate protest in Amsterdam.
Addressing tens of thousands at the Climate Crisis Coalition, @GretaThunberg said that as a climate justice movement, “we have to listen to the voices of those who are being oppressed and those who are fighting for freedom and justice.” https://t.co/N7CcDafsXP pic.twitter.com/VE8kleNv64

Media reports quote Volker Becker, the president of the German-Israeli Society (DIG), as saying that her statements marked “the end of Greta Thunberg as a climate activist” adding that “from now, Israel hater is the main job” for the activist. DIG is a German-based organization that promotes relations with Israel.
Addressing the crowd at the protest on Sunday, Thunberg had urged a “ceasefire now” and said that “as a climate justice activist, we have to listen to the voices of those who are being oppressed and those who are fighting for freedom and for justice.”
Thunberg had also given the stage to a Palestinian woman as well as Afghan activist Sahar Shizad.
During her speech, she was also interrupted by a man who took to the stage saying he had come for a climate protest, “not a political view.”
On Monday, the Israeli embassy in Germany posted on X that “it’s sad how Greta Thunberg is once again abusing the climate state for its own purposes. No stage for anti-semites.”

Fridays for Future’s international group has said “We condemn the current attacks of the Israeli government, the expulsion of millions of Palestinians, and the killings of civilians.”
Luisa Neubauer, who heads the German chapter of Fridays for Future, reportedly told Die Zeit weekly she was “disappointed” in Thunberg.
Neubauer is further reported as saying that Thunberg was “extraordinarily reflective and far-sighted” in the past but that the German climate branch will now have to examine “with whom we still have a basis to work based on common values”.
