A peacekeeping patrol of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has been hit by Israeli military gunfire in southern Lebanon.
The attack took place near the Aytaroun village on Saturday.
“No peacekeepers were injured, but the vehicle was damaged,” said UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander, Aroldo Lázaro, in a statement on X.
This incident occurred during a period of relative calm along the Blue Line, he added.
The Blue Line is a demarcation line set by the UN for the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Lebanon in 2000.

“I am concerned by the ongoing intensification of the exchanges of fire along the Blue Line that has already claimed too many lives, caused significant damage, and jeopardized livelihoods,” Lázaro said.
“We condemn this act,” he added. “And underscore the parties’ responsibility to safeguard peacekeepers, preventing unnecessary risks to those striving to establish stability”.
The UNIFIL official “strongly” reminded the parties of their obligations to protect peacekeepers “and avoid putting the men and women who are working to restore stability at risk.”
Since the start of the Israeli assault on Gaza, on October 7, the Lebanese Resistance movement Hezbollah has engaged directly, but relatively in a limited way in the war against the Israeli occupation.

According to Hezbollah sources, the movement has killed, as of November 1, at least 120 soldiers, and wounded many more, while targeting numerous military bases, intelligence installations, and other Israeli positions across the Lebanon-Israel border.
Israel has occupied parts of Lebanon for decades and has only left the country in 2000, following stiff Lebanese resistance under Hezbollah’s leadership.
It attempted to re-occupy Lebanon in 2006 but failed in what Lebanon considers a major victory against Israel.

Israel, however, continues to occupy parts of Lebanon, namely the Sheeba Farms region.
Hezbollah has vowed to recover every inch of Lebanon that has been occupied by Israel contrary to international law.
