The tragic death toll continues to mount as Israeli occupation forces intensify their airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, leaving a number of Palestinians dead and many others injured. 
The latest airstrikes targeted displaced individuals east of Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip, leaving many casualties.
The Israeli occupation military also bombed various areas in northern Gaza, focusing its recent attacks on the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in Gaza City. The strikes resulted in casualties and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.

Israeli airstrikes, accompanied by indiscriminate artillery shelling, were reported in the neighborhoods of Tuffah, Shujaeya, and Yafa Street in Gaza City. Additionally, Israeli artillery targeted the Nuzha neighborhood in Jabalia, north of Gaza.
On Thursday evening, a new massacre unfolded in Jabalia refugee camp, where at least 18 civilians were killed and several others were injured in an Israeli airstrike targeting residential buildings. 
OXFAM: Famine is being used as a weapon in the Israeli war against the Gaza Strip. One million people displaced to the south of the Strip live without electricity, water and little food. This is collective punishment. #Gaza https://t.co/xgCvaWerTQ

The victims included members of the Abu Al-Qumsan, Masoud, Al-Assali, Al-Tululi, Abu Dan, and Abu Dayr families.
Videos from the scene documented citizens and rescue teams attempting to retrieve the bodies of the deceased and rescue those trapped under the rubble of destroyed homes.
Later, an Israeli airstrike targeted the Falouja neighborhood in Jabalia, resulting in the murder of three more civilians.
With all hospitals in Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip out of service due to the dire conditions at the Baptist Hospital and the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, the situation has become increasingly critical. 
Now that the Israeli war on #Gaza seems to have failed to achieve any of its initial objectives, the #US and its European allies are pushing for the deployment of a peacekeeping force in the Gaza Strip, according to Bloomberg.https://t.co/NNI0uldBLo pic.twitter.com/vQ2ypZxU4k

Tank incursions by Israeli occupation forces around the Jordanian Field Hospital have also added to the challenges faced by medical teams.
Gaza has also been cut off from the outside world, with a complete disruption of landline and mobile telecommunications and internet services. The Israeli blockade, the depletion of fuel necessary to operate key network components, and the ongoing massacres across the Gaza Strip have contributed to the isolation and deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the region.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,500 Palestinians, including 4,710 children and 3,160 women. The number of wounded has reached 29,800.
