Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of San Francisco, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, as the city prepares to host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
The gathering took place in the city’s downtown on Tuesday evening, with crowds chanting “Genocidal Joe, he must go,” according to local media.

Videos posted on social media also show a large crowd, chanting “Free Palestine” as well as “From the River to the Sea,” a political slogan calling for the unification of Palestinian territories at the expense of Israel. Many demonstrators were seen carrying Palestinian flags and beating drums.
According to the San Francisco Standard, some speakers who addressed the demonstrators urged the US – Israel’s key supporter – to stop contributing billions of dollars in military aid and instead focus on fighting poverty in America.
The APEC summit, an international forum that includes 21 nations and accounts for around 60% of global GDP, opened on Saturday and is scheduled to wrap up on Friday.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,360 Palestinians, including 4,609 children and 3,100 women. The number of wounded has reached 28,200. 
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
