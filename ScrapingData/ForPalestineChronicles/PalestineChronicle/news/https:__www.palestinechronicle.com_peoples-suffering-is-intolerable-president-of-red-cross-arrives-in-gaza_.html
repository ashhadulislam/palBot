“I repeat our urgent call for civilians to be protected in line with the laws of war and for aid to enter unimpeded” – President of the International Committee of the Red Cross Mirjana Spoljaric Egger.
President of the International Committee of the Red Cross Mirjana Spoljaric Egger arrived in the Gaza Strip on Monday where she stated that “people’s suffering is intolerable,” the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
“I repeat our urgent call for civilians to be protected in line with the laws of war and for aid to enter unimpeded,” she said on her official account on X.
“The last week provided a small degree of humanitarian respite, a positive glimpse of humanity that raised hopes around the world that a path to reduced suffering could now be found,” Spoljaric Egger said in a statement.
