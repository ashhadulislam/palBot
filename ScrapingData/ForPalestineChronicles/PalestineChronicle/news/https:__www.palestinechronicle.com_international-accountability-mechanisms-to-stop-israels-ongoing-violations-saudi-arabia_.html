“The Kingdom stresses the necessity of activating international accountability mechanisms regarding these ongoing violations by the Israeli occupation forces” – Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia today condemned on Thursday Israel’s storming of Al-Shifa Medical Complex and the bombing of the Jordanian Field Hospital in the Gaza Strip, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
“The Foreign Ministry expresses the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s strong condemnation and rejection of the Israeli occupation forces storming Al-Shifa Medical Hospital and bombing the vicinity of the Jordanian Field Hospital in the besieged Gaza Strip,” the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
This is “a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, all international norms and conventions, and explicit targeting of civilians and medical personnel,” the statement added.

“The Kingdom stresses the necessity of activating international accountability mechanisms regarding these ongoing violations and brutal and inhumane practices by the Israeli occupation forces, against children, women, civilians, health facilities, and relief teams,” the statement concluded.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,500 Palestinians, including 4,710 children.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
