Türkiye’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has called on the West to distance itself from Israeli “war crimes.”
“The Western world should distance itself from Israel’s war crimes. Any conditional or unconditional support to Israel is a blank check for the killing of more Palestinians,” Fidan said at the International Strategic Communication (Stratcom) Summit in Istanbul, on Friday, reports Turkish media.
He said, “History will not forget the intolerance to the Palestinian flag and calls for peace in today’s Europe, where attacks on the holy Quran are supposedly accepted as freedom of expression.”
The Turkish official stressed that genuine peace is only possible with justice, international cooperation, and truth.
He said the same kind of disinformation that paved the way for interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and plunged the region into chaos is now surfacing in Gaza, the reports say.

Fidan added that there are two types of disinformation regarding “war crimes committed by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank” after the events of October 7.
“The first is the biased attitude of many Western media outlets that ignore the human tragedy suffered by the Palestinians,” he explained.
“The other is the institutionalized disinformation, which is not limited to the October 7 events, that Israel is trying to convince the whole world by hiding the facts.”
The reports add that he said no one should legitimize “Israel’s merciless killing of people in Gaza” as a right to self-defense.
“We should not allow Israel to cover one war crime with another. Therefore, we must reach a permanent solution through new discourses and methods,” he emphasized.
Fidan criticized Tel Aviv saying its aim is to render the two-state solution ineffective with its actions in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza.

He stressed that “it is widely accepted that the only viable solution to the Israel-Palestine issue is an independent, sovereign, and geographically integrated Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.”
Fidan also emphasized that Türkiye will never shy away from taking on its responsibilities and standing by Palestinians in their cause”, the reports concluded.
