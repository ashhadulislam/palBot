A humanitarian pause came into effect in the Gaza Strip at 7 am local time this morning. 
The latest Israeli aggression on Gaza started on October 7, resulting in the killing of nearly 15,000 Palestinians.
The four-day humanitarian pause, subject to extension, will include the release of as many as 150 Palestinian detainees, currently held in Israeli occupation prisons. 
It also involves the delivery of badly needed humanitarian aid and fuel supplies into the besieged enclave.
The ceasefire has now gone into effect at 7:00 AM.

In the hours leading up to the ceasefire, the Israeli occupation forces intensified their airstrikes in the northern, central, and southern regions of Gaza. 
These strikes targeted schools housing displaced civilians, hospitals, and homes, resulting in dozens of casualties.
Throughout the ceasefire period, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza will not be able to return to their homes in northern Gaza to assess the damage to their homes and properties. 
The Israeli occupation forces, which invaded the northern regions of Gaza with tanks and armored personnel carriers, have threatened to target returning civilians.
