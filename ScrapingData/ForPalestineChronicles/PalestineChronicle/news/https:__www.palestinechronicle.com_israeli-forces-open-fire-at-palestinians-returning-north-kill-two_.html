Israeli forces opened fire at Palestinians trying to reach their homes in the northern area, killing two and wounding more.
Two Palestinians were killed and others were injured when Israeli occupation forces opened fire at citizens who were trying to return to the northern Gaza Strip, soon after the start of the humanitarian truce on Friday morning, Al-Jazeera reported.
The wounded were reportedly moved to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah.
Soon after the beginning of the four-day humanitarian truce, on Friday morning, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians began returning to their neighborhoods and homes in various areas of the Gaza Strip to inspect them.

The Israeli army, however, dropped leaflets throughout the southern region reading: “To the residents of the Gaza Strip, the war is not over yet. The humanitarian truce is temporary, and the northern area of the Gaza Strip is a war zone.”
“You must remain in the humanitarian area located in the south of the Strip and you must not go to the north,” the leaflet continued.
