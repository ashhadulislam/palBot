On the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, the Palestinian Resistance Movement Hamas has called for escalating “all forms of mass activism”.
The Palestinian Resistance Movement Hamas has called for the escalation of worldwide Pro-Palestine protests on the occasion of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, in rejection of the Israeli bloody aggression on the Gaza Strip and in support of the Palestinian right to freedom and independence.
“On the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, November 29, we call on the masses of our people, the Arab and Islamic nation, and the free people of the world to escalate all forms of mass activism, pro-Gaza protests and rallies in condemnation of the Israeli heinous crimes and genocidal war waged against our people for more than 50 days,” Hamas said in a statement issued on Tuesday.
Hamas also renewed its calls for “expanding and sustaining mobilizations in all cities, capitals, and squares around the world in support of the rights of our people to liberation, return and self-determination and to denounce the Israeli aggression and war crimes in order to push for criminalizing and halting Israeli crimes and violations”.
November 29 marks the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People when the United Nations General Assembly adopted Partition Resolution 181 in 1947.
The resolution provided for the establishment of a Jewish state and an Arab state, with Jerusalem as a corpus separatum under a special international regime.
