Netanyahu is using the military operation in Gaza to extend his government’s political life while threatening the security of the entire region, according to Turkish President Erdogan.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is using the military operation in Gaza to extend its political life, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, according to Russian news agency TASS.
“The Netanyahu administration is committing crimes against humanity, war crimes, in a bid to extend its political life while putting the security of our entire region in danger,” Erdogan said at a summit of Persian Gulf countries in Doha, as cited by the TRT Haber TV channel.

According to Erdogan, Ankara has sent two planes and two civilian ships with humanitarian aid for Gazans, transferring the sick and the wounded to Turkiye for medical treatment.
The Turkish president noted that Ankara’s priority was to establish an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, ensure lasting peace and unhindered humanitarian aid deliveries to the region, as well as resolving the Palestine issue based on the two-state principle.
“Recent developments only confirm the need to create an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with its capital in Eastern Jerusalem,” he said.

Erdogan also highlighted the need to prevent the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from spilling over into Syria. “We cannot allow the Gaza massacre to expand into a war that will engulf Syria,” the Turkish leader stressed.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes across various areas of Gaza since Friday morning, as Israel resumed its aggression after a seven-day truce, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said in a statement.
Since October 7, over 15,899 Palestinians, including over 6,200 children and more than 4,000 women were killed, with another 41,316 wounded, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
