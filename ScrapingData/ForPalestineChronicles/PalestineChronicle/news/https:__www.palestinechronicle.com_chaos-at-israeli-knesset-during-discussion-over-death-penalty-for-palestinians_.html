Relatives of those held captive by the Palestinian Resistance movement Hamas in Gaza have pleaded with Gvir not to advance the bill.
Israel’s far-right Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party has submitted a controversial bill on “executing Palestinian prisoners”, Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said on Saturday.
Ben-Gvir explained that his party, “is the one that submitted the draft law to execute Palestinian prisoners,” adding that the draft “is expected to receive support by all members of the Knesset”.

Relatives of those held captive by the Palestinian Resistance movement Hamas in Gaza have pleaded with Gvir not to advance the bill, in fear that this could have repercussions, Israeli media reported.
According to The Times of Israel, this led to a “furious altercation” during the hearing of the Knesset National Security Committee, which is discussing the draft law. 
“Stop talking about killing Arabs and start speaking about saving Jews,” the relative of one of the Israeli captives reportedly shouted during the hearing, triggering a strong reaction from Otzma Yehudit MKs.
“You have no monopoly over pain,” MK Almog Cohen replied, according to The Times of Israel. “We have also buried more than 50 friends,” he reportedly said, referring to the attack on southern Israel carried out by Hamas on October 7.
Last March, the Israeli Knesset (parliament) approved, in a preliminary reading, a draft law that allows a return of the death penalty for Palestinian prisoners convicted of killing Israelis.
