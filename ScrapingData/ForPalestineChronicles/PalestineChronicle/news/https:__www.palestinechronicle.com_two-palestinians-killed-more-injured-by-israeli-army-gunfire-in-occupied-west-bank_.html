According to WAFA, Israeli occupation soldiers raided a number of buildings surrounding Daras’ house and forced their residents to evacuate them as the soldiers climbed onto their roofs.
Daras was shot and killed on August 31 at the Ni’lin military checkpoint. Israeli forces claimed that he had allegedly carried out a car-ramming attack near the illegal Israeli settlement of Mod’een.
