At least nine Palestinian civilians were killed and others were injured on Wednesday morning in a new massacre committed by the Israeli occupation forces by targeting a house in the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip.
The Israeli occupation forces committed another massacre in northern Gaza at dawn Wednesday, killing more than 60 people from the Jabaliya camp in northeastern Gaza.
At least 15 people were killed on Tuesday evening and others were injured in a massacre committed by the Israeli occupation forces by targeting a residential apartment in Hamad City, west of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip.
Medical sources said five people, including three rescue crews, were killed in an Israeli attack carried out on Tuesday evening in the Jabaliya refugee camp.
According to WAFA, the number of people killed in the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday reached about 120, in addition to dozens of wounded and missing people as a result of the continuous Israeli occupation bombing of homes, hospitals and ambulances.
Kamal Adwan Hospital
The situation in the northern area remains dire. About 60 bodies and 200 wounded were brought into the Kamal Adwan Hospital overnight, hospital director Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout told Al-Jazeera television on Wednesday. 
Dr. Al-Kahlout said that the situation is catastrophic. Israeli airstrikes have affected all areas and targeted buildings in the vicinity of the hospital. “We are using cooking oil to keep the generators running,” he said.
The next few hours are crucial to the success of the ceasefire. News reports speak of intense Israeli bombardment of various residential targets in central Gaza. Many bodies are also being pulled from the rubble of destroyed homes.https://t.co/aoNLznDjzG pic.twitter.com/kNDSa2xBff

Indonesian Hospital
Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinians, including patients, displaced civilians and medical staff, are still inside the besieged Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza.
Eyewitnesses also confirmed that the occupation forces abused the wounded in the Indonesian hospital, forced them to crawl, and arrested a number of them.
Citing the head of the hospital’s nursing department, the spokesperson for the Health Ministry in Gaza said on Tuesday that “there are corpses in all departments, and we lost many lives due to lack of supplies.”
“There are 60 bodies in front of the mortuaries,” the spokesperson said, adding they will be buried in courtyards inside the hospital.”
