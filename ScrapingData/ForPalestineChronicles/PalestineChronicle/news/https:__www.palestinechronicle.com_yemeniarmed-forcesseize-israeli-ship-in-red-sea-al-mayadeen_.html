Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed the news, blaming Iran for the incident.
According to Israeli media, “the ship captured by the Yemenis is owned by Israeli businessman Rami Ungar.” 
“The cargo ship, Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader, was leased from a British company partly owned by Israeli Rami Unger to a Japanese company,” The Jerusalem post reported.
An Israeli military spokesperson described the event as “a very dangerous development.”
  Earlier on Sunday, Yemen’s Armed Forces, allied with the Ansarallah resistance movement, had announced that they would target all vessels associated with Israel in the Red Sea, calling on countries to withdraw their citizens operating on such ships.
“To provide relief to our oppressed people in Gaza,” the armed forces announced, “they will target … ships carrying the flag of the Zionist entity, ships operated by Israeli companies, ships owned by Israeli companies.”
