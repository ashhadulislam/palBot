As expected, the Israeli military operation in Khan Yunis has turned out to be the most difficult as indicated by the latest reports from the battlefield.
Today, Tuesday, December 5, was a bad day for the Israeli army at all fronts. 
Though hundreds of Palestinians were killed and wounded in Israeli attacks at civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army suffered particularly heavy losses, while still failing to prevent the firing of rockets from Gaza to Israel. 
These are some of the highlights of today’s fighting, according to statements issued by the various Palestinian Resistance groups, the Lebanese group Hezbollah, the Israeli army and media reports.
