UPDATE: According to Reuters news agency, Saudi Arabia has, on Tuesday, won the bid to host the Expo 2030.
Israel has reportedly decided to withdraw its support for Saudi Arabia’s bid to host the Expo 2030 World Fair.
According to The Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (KAN), Israel had in the past supported the kingdom’s bid as a host country. 
Quoting Israeli sources, it said they had now decided to back Italy instead.
KAN said the decision was taken by the relevant Israeli authorities, although no official statement on the issue has been released. 
Even though Saudi Arabia was not in any way a party in the war between Israel and the Palestinian Resistance, the rich Arab Kingdom was also present in every geopolitical analysis concerning the war. https://t.co/v8wneUOq0b pic.twitter.com/6oBvqFs0Fo

Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Italy are competing to win the bid to host the international exhibition. The event attracts millions of people and brings with it investment opportunities. 
The final vote for declaring the winning country will be made on Tuesday in Paris.
Riyadh, along with other Arab countries, has been critical of the Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip.
The current onslaught came at a time when Saudi Arabia and Israel were moving towards a normalization of relations between the two countries.
