Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said that one of its convoys was deliberately attacked by the Israeli occupation forces during their evacuation from the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in central Gaza City on Saturday.
MSF confirmed in a statement on its official website on Sunday that one of its employees’ relatives was killed and another was injured in the attack on the convoy.
MSF condemned in the strongest terms the deliberate Israeli attack. It said the convoy was made up of 137 people—Palestinian MSF staff members and their families, including 65 children. Since November 11, they have been trapped in MSF’s guesthouse, office and outpatient clinic near Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza as a result of the Israeli invasion.

MSF said its staff and families departed at 9:00 a.m. local time yesterday with five vehicles, all clearly marked with MSF identification, including on the roofs. It added that the convoy went through the itinerary indicated by the Israeli army and reached Salah Al Deen street, along with other civilians trying to leave the area.
The convoy reached the last checkpoint near Wadi Gaza, which was overcrowded at that time due to extensive screenings of Palestinians by Israeli forces.
“Despite the information shared with the Israeli army, they were not allowed to cross the checkpoint for hours. Shots were later heard by our staff, pushing them to turn back out of fear to return to MSF’s premises, located around seven kilometers [about four miles] from the checkpoint.”
“On their way back, between 3:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. local time, the convoy was attacked in Al-Wehda street near the junction of Said Al A’as street, near the MSF office,” MSF added. “Two of the MSF vehicles were deliberately hit, killing one MSF staff’s family member and injuring another.”
MSF called for an immediate ceasefire to ensure the safety of trapped civilians.
