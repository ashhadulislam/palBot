In an interview with the Israeli Channel 12, Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid said that “Israel has lost faith in the prime minister.”
Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said on Wednesday evening that he would join a government led by the right only if it excluded the current prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his hard-line allies, Israeli media reported.
In an interview with the Israeli Channel 12, Lapid said that “Israel has lost faith in the prime minister.”
“We cannot allow ourselves to conduct an extended war with a prime minister that the public does not trust,” Lapid reportedly added, saying that Netanyahu “must go now.”

Netanyahu’s majority party, Likud, said in a statement that “It is regrettable and shameful that Lapid is engaging in politics during a time of war”.
Lapid’s party, Yesh Atid, however, countered by saying that “Lapid proposed a government led by the Likud, with a Likud prime minister who is not Netanyahu. That is how we will begin the national healing.”
According to a poll published on November 5 by Channel 12, 76 percent of Israelis want Netanyahu to resign, while 64 percent believe that new elections should be held immediately after the war.
The poll comes amid increasing tensions and protests across Israel, with demonstrators calling for a ceasefire and the release of the Israelis currently held in Gaza.
