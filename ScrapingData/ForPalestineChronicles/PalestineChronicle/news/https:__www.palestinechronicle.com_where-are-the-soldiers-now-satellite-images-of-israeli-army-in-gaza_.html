Images taken on November 24 show Israeli forces digging a trench starting from the Juhr Al-Dik area, located east of the central Gaza Strip region.
Analysis of satellite images revealed a series of developments in terms of operations carried out by the Israeli occupation army in the besieged Gaza Strip.
The analysis was based on satellite images obtained by Al-Jazeera, covering the period between November 24 and 30.
Trench in the Middle of Gaza
Images taken on November 24 show Israeli forces digging a trench starting from the Juhr Al-Dik area, located east of the central Gaza Strip region.
The length of the trench is estimated to be about 1.8 kilometers.
The excavation has grown to 2.7 kilometers long, according to November 30 photos. 
The purpose of digging the trench is not yet known.

Road to the Sea
The images also showed the Israeli army constructing a road that cuts across the entire center of Gaza, from the entrance to Juhr Al-Dik in the east to the seashore in the west. 
Israeli forces paved the road to facilitate the faster movement of vehicles.
Currently, a large number of vehicles are concentrated outside the Gaza Strip east of the entrance to Juhr Al-Dik, and these vehicles may be part of the armored vehicles that withdrew during the truce, and may be in the process of preparing for any possible new operations.
