Israel’s violence in the occupied West Bank has increased significantly since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza on October 7. 
Israeli occupation forces continue to carry out military raids across West Bank cities and refugee camps, along with mass detention campaigns. 
Al-Khalil (Hebron)
Two young Palestinian men were killed on Monday evening after they were shot by Israeli occupation forces in the town of Sa’ir, northeast of Al-Khalil (Hebron).
The Palestinian Ministry of Health said that Anas Ismail al-Froukh, 23, and Mohammad Saa’di al-Frouk, 22, died due to the severe injuries they sustained by Israeli army gunfire.
WAFA correspondent said that Israeli forces fired live bullets at two young men while they were in the Ras Al-Aroud area, south of Sa’ir, wounding one of them in the back and the other in the chest.
The two young Palestinians were transferred to Al-Ahli Hospital in Hebron, where their injuries were reported to be critical. They were later pronounced dead.
