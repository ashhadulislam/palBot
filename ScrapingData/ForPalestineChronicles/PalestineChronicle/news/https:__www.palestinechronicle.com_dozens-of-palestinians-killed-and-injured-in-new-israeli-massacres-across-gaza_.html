Eight Palestinians were killed in an Israeli bombing of the Al-Barakah family home in Bani Suheila, in the southern Gaza area of Khan Yunis.
Dozens of Palestinians were killed and injured on the 38th day of Israel’s aggression on the Gaza Strip while thousands of people are still trapped in the hospitals in Gaza City, suffering from lack of food, water and medical supplies.
WAFA correspondent said Israeli warplanes bombed al-Rimal, Tal al-Hawa, al-Tuffah, the Sheikh Ajlin neighborhoods west of Gaza City, and the Shati (Beach) refugee camp, killing and wounding dozens of civilians, without ambulances being able to reach them due to being surrounded by tanks.

Meanwhile, the occupation warplanes continued their raids and bombardment in the vicinity of the hospitals, where they completely destroyed the cardiovascular department building in the al-Shifa Medical Complex. 
Tens of thousands of displaced, wounded, and sick Palestinians are still trapped in the hospital after being besieged for the fourth day in a row, amid a complete outage of electricity, water, and food.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 20 patients have died inside al-Shifa Medical Complex so far due to the outage of electricity and medicines, including two premature babies.
All 3,000 oncology patients who were being treated in al-Rantisi and the Turkish hospitals were now left to die after the occupation expelled them from the hospitals.

WAFA correspondent said those trapped inside the al-Shifa Complex sent a distress call to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and international organizations urging them to provide milk and diapers for the infants who suffer from a lack of the most basic necessities of life and the inability of the hospital to provide them their basic needs.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City was out of service and completely stopped working yesterday due to the depletion of fuel and a power outage.
A total of 23 out of 35 hospitals have completely stopped operating, and the occupation forces are still besieging many hospitals, preventing entry or exit for medical staff, paramedics, and patients.
The ongoing Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip since October 7 has resulted in more than 11,078 deaths, including 4,506 children and 3,027 women, in addition to the injury of 27,490 others, the majority of whom are women and children.
