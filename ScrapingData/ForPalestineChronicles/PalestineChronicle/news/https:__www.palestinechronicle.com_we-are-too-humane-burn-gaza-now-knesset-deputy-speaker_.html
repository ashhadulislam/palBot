The deputy speaker of Israel’s Knesset, Nissim Vaturi, has called for Gaza to be burnt down.
“All of this preoccupation with whether or not there is internet in Gaza shows that we have learned nothing,” Nissim Vaturi posted on the social media platform, X, on Friday.
“We are too humane. Burn Gaza now no less!” he said.
“Don’t allow fuel in, don’t allow water in until the hostages are returned back!” the far-right Likud politician added.

Vaturi’s comments are the latest in a number of inflammatory remarks by Israeli politicians on the Israeli onslaught on Gaza.
Earlier this month, Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahu suggested using nuclear weapons against the Palestinian enclave.
A few days later, Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter said during an interview that Israel’s military operation was the “2023 Gaza Nakba”.
During the Nakba, translated as ‘The Catastrophe’, nearly 500 villages were destroyed, entire Palestinian towns depopulated and approximately 800,000 Palestinians exiled to make room for Jewish immigrants who arrived from all corners of the globe.
AL-JAZEERA: Palestinian Journalist Imad Zaqout told Al Jazeera that about 200 were killed in a new massacre at Al Fakhoura, in Jabalia, north of Gaza.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 12,000 Palestinians, including 5,000 children and over 3,000 women.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
