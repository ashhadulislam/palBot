Dozens of Palestinians were killed on Wednesday morning, and many others were injured, as a result of a series of raids carried out by Israeli warplanes in several areas of the besieged Gaza Strip.
The Interior Ministry in Gaza announced that the bodies of three Palestinians arrived at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital following Israel’s bombing of Al-Salhi Towers in Al-Nuseirat.
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that Israeli aircraft bombed several homes in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood, in the northern Gaza Strip, killing 25 Palestinians, the majority of whom were children and women.
According to Al-Jazeera, the Israeli artillery also bombed Al-Salam Mill in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, coinciding with the incursion of Israeli vehicles and tanks.

The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
