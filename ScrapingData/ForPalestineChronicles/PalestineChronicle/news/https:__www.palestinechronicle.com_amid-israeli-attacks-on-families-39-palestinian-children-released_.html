Prior to his release, the Israeli police beat members of the Abbasi family in Jerusalem, and fired at other families in the Ramallah area. 
The Israeli army released on Sunday 39 Palestinian children detainees within the terms of the truce agreement, which entered its third day in the Gaza Strip.
The release of the children was accompanied by attacks carried out by the Israeli occupation army targeting Palestinians who gathered in large numbers to celebrate the freedom of the youth. 
Hours after the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, released a third batch of detainees in Gaza, including 13 Israelis, the Israeli Prison Administration Authority announced the release of the 39 Palestinians, all of them children.
Al-Jazeera correspondent said that the occupation forces fired bullets and tear gas canisters in Beitunia near Ramallah to prevent Palestinians from filming a bus carrying the liberated children.
The occupation army also dispersed hundreds of Palestinians who gathered outside the Ofer military prison, west of Ramallah, who were waiting for the release of the children. The Palestinian Red Crescent said in a brief statement that its crews dealt with two injuries in the area.
On the other hand, Al-Jazeera said that one of the released children, Amin Abbasi arrived at his home in the town of Silwan in occupied East Jerusalem, after the Israeli occupation police released him on Sunday evening.
Prior to his release, the Israeli police beat members of the Abbasi family, Al-Jazeera correspondent said.
