Israeli forces have intensified their airstrikes across various areas of the Gaza Strip, leading to dozens of casualties among the civilian population.
Dozens of Palestinian civilians, including children, were killed and many others injured in a series of Israeli airstrikes on various areas in the Gaza Strip on Sunday afternoon, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
WAFA correspondent said that more than 60 people were killed in the southern regions of Gaza, specifically in Khan Yunis, after Israeli warplanes targeted multiple areas in the east and center of the city, leading to multiple casualties.  
Moreover, Israeli reconnaissance planes bombed a house belonging to the Farra family in the town of Al-Qarara, northeast of Khan Yunis, resulting in the death of two civilians. 
“They have killed my father,” the little girl cries as she rubs the burns on her face, with a broken arm.
“No, stop, don’t touch the burns on your face,” her aunt says.
The girl, again, cries for her dead parents.

In the northern part of the Strip, warplanes attacked houses in the Jabaliya refugee camp and the town of Beit Lahiya, leading to dozens of fatalities and injuries, who were transported to local hospitals, including the Indonesian, Kamal Adwan, and Al-Awda in the northern Gaza Strip.
Aerial bombardment is accompanied by shelling from artillery and naval ships on various neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip, especially in the eastern and western coastal areas. 
WAFA correspondent explained that Israeli military vehicles have cut off roads between central and southern Gaza, in addition to blocking the road between Khan Yunis and Rafah in the southern part of the enclave.

Dr. Marwan al-Hams, the director of Abu Yousef Al-Najjar Hospital in Rafah, stated that the hospital received 10 dead bodies and dozens of wounded during the night and until dawn, with the majority being children and women.
He noted that there are many injuries with bone fractures and other serious injuries to the chest and abdomen, despite the limited resources and the scarcity of specialists, which threatens to halt the emergency services at the hospital.
Al-Hams pointed out that the hospital’s capacity has declined from 63 beds to 42 after the pediatric department went out of service and is undergoing rehabilitation to accommodate the wounded.
