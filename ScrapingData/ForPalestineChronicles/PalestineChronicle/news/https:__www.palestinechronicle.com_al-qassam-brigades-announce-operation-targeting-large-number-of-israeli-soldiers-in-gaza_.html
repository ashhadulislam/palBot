The Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Palestinian Resistance Movement Hamas, announced on Sunday an operation targeting a large number of Israeli invading soldiers in Gaza. 
According to a statement released by Al-Qassam, their fighters managed to locate 60 soldiers who were positioned east of Juhr al-Dik, south of Gaza City. 
The fighters reportedly targeted the invading Israeli forces with three anti-personnel devices and they withdrew to their positions safely, after killing and wounding a large number of Israeli soldiers.

“At exactly 4:30, the devices were detonated among the occupation soldiers, and one of the fighters advanced to deal with the remaining members of the force,” the statement read.
“After inflicting significant casualties among the occupation soldiers, they withdrew safely to their positions.”
The operation comes after a bloody night, when scores of Palestinians were reportedly killed and more wounded across the Gaza Strip.
