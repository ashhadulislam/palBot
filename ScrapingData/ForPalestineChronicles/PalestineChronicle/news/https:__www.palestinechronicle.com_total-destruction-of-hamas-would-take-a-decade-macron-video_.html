French President Emmanuel Macron said Israel “must more precisely define” its end goals, as the stated aim of eliminating the Palestinian Resistance Movement Hamas would take a decade. 
Speaking at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN COP28 climate conference in Dubai, Macron questioned whether “anyone thinks it’s possible” to wipe out Hamas.
“If it is the aim, the war will last for 10 years,” he argued.
“There can be no long-term security for Israel in the region, if that security comes at the price of Palestinian lives, affecting the public opinions in the region,” Macron continued.

Macron’s comments came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Saturday to continue with the ground offensive in Gaza until “all its objections” are achieved, namely rescuing remaining hostages and completely “obliterating Hamas.”
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes across various areas of Gaza since Friday morning, as Israel resumed its aggression after a seven-day truce, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said in a statement.
“They have killed my father,” the little girl cries as she rubs the burns on her face, with a broken arm.
“No, stop, don’t touch the burns on your face,” her aunt says.
The girl, again, cries for her dead parents.
