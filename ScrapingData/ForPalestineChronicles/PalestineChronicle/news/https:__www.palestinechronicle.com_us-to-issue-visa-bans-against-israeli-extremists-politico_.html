Biden has ordered his administration to draw up a plan of sanctions against Israeli settlers who attack or harass Palestinians in the West Bank, Politico reported.
United States President Joe Biden has ordered his administration to draw up a plan of sanctions against Israeli Jewish settlers who attack or harass Palestinians in the West Bank, Politico reported on Saturday, citing a confidential document.
A cabinet memo was reportedly read out to the outlet by a senior US official. 
The memo had been sent to top Biden administration officials, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, directing their departments “to develop policy options for expeditious action against those responsible for the conduct of violence in the West Bank.” A list of possible restrictions is said to include visa bans.
The US may impose restrictions specifically on persons who “have directly or indirectly engaged in actions or policies that threaten the security or stability of the West Bank,” and who have taken part in intimidating or displacing civilians there, the document reportedly says. 
Other grounds for sanctions could allegedly include human rights violations and actions that “significantly obstruct, disrupt or prevent efforts to achieve a two-state solution.”
In an op-ed published on Saturday in the Washington Post, Biden reaffirmed his commitment to the two-state solution.
While refraining from calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, Biden wrote that he was opposed to any forcible displacement of Palestinians from the enclave, and to its reoccupation or blockading by Israeli forces. 
He also noted that he told Tel Aviv that “extremist violence against Palestinians in the West Bank must stop.”
To punish those engaged in those activities, Washington is ready “to take [its] own steps, including issuing visa bans against extremists attacking civilians in the West Bank,” Biden added.
Over 600,000 Israelis live in Jewish-only settlements across occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in violation of international law.
