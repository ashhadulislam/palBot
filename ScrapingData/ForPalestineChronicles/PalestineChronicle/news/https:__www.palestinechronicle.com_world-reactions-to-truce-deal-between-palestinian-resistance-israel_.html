“We welcome the agreement that will liberate women and children, and it must be followed by other steps in compliance with international law,” the Belgian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Iran
Iran announced that Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian will begin a regional tour, starting in Lebanon, following the ceasefire announcement.

The next few hours are crucial to the success of the ceasefire. News reports speak of intense Israeli bombardment of various residential targets in central Gaza. Many bodies are also being pulled from the rubble of destroyed homes.https://t.co/aoNLznDjzG pic.twitter.com/kNDSa2xBff
