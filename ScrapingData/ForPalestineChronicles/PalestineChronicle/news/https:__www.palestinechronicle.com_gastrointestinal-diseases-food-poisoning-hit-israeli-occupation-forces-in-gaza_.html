An outbreak of gastrointestinal diseases and food poisoning has been reported among Israeli soldiers who are deployed in the Gaza Strip, Israeli media reported.
According to the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, Israeli forces in Gaza faced an “extraordinary rise” in this kind of disease.
Yedioth Ahronot reported that 18 Israeli soldiers were evacuated from Gaza to receive medical treatment after they were infected with an outbreak of dysentery, and symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea.
“Diarrhoea has spread among soldiers in the south (of Israel), across various areas of concentration, and then it spread among soldiers who went to combat in Gaza,” explained the Head of the Infectious Disease Unit at Assuta Ashdod University Hospital, Dr. Tal Brosh.

“We diagnosed infections with the Shigella bacteria which causes dysentery, a very dangerous disease that has spread among Israeli soldiers in Gaza,” Dr. Brosh reportedly added.
Broch added that the outbreak of these diseases has consequences on the condition of soldiers and the conduct of combat operations.
“If the infection spreads among ten soldiers in an infantry company, and they develop a fever after their temperature reaches 40 degrees Celsius, and they start having diarrhea every 20 minutes, then they are no longer fit to fight and they expose themselves to the risk of death,” he pointed out.
However, Israeli soldiers are not only facing gastrointestinal problems.
According to the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation (KAN), at least 2,000 soldiers have received psychiatric support since the beginning of the operation on October 7.
