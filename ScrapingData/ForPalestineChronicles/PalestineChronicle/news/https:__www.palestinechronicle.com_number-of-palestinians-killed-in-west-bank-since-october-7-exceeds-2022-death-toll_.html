A previous statement by the UN Humanitarian Affairs Office (OCHA) said 171 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank in 2022 by Israeli forces and settlers.
The number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank since October 7 accounts for 48% of all Palestinian fatalities in the West Bank in 2023 (452), according to an OCHA statement published on November 23.
The statement says that about 66% of the fatalities since October 7 have occurred during confrontations that followed Israeli search-and-arrest operations, primarily in Jenin and Tulkarm governorates; 24% have been in the context of demonstrations concerning Gaza; seven percent have been killed while attacking or allegedly attacking Israeli forces or settlers; two percent have been killed in settler attacks against Palestinians; and one percent during punitive demolitions.

Since October 7, Israeli forces have injured 2,866 Palestinians in the West Bank, including at least 364 children, over half of them in the context of demonstrations, the statement adds.
An additional 78 Palestinians have been injured by settlers. Some 33% of those injuries have been caused by live ammunition.
The Israeli army has also arrested in the same period after October 7 more than 3,000 Palestinians from the West Bank in addition to the already 5,200 Palestinians held in Israeli jails before October 7.
