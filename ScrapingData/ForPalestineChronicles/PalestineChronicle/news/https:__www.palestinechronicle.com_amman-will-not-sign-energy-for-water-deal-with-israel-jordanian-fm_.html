Amman will not sign an agreement to provide energy to Israel in exchange for water and that was supposed to be signed last month.
The Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said on Thursday that Amman will not sign an agreement to provide energy to Israel in exchange for water and that was supposed to be signed last month.
In an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday evening, Safadi said that Jordan is doing everything it believes will help support the Palestinian people.

Amman is leveraging its relationships to demand an end to the bombing of Gaza and to warn against the occupation’s actions that could push the region toward disaster, the minister added.
Safadi stressed that Israeli occupation forces are committing war crimes and their actions cannot be viewed as self-defense, and if any other country did what Israel is doing, it would face sanctions.
He pointed out that Israel is pushing the entire region towards hell, and the world must face the fact that what the entity is doing has destroyed decades of efforts to build a peaceful environment.
Safadi stressed that Israel bears the consequences of what it is doing in Gaza, as it is creating an environment of violence.

If the international community wants to talk about the day after the war, it must stop what is happening now, and international institutions must take a clear stance on what is happening in the Strip, he concluded.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,500 Palestinians, including 4,710 children and 3,160 women. The number of wounded has reached 29,800.
The Israeli army continues to pound civilian homes throughout the Gaza Strip with new massacres reported everywhere in the besieged enclave.
Gaza has been under a tight Israeli military siege since 2007, following a democratic election in occupied Palestine, the results of which were rejected by Tel Aviv and Washington.
