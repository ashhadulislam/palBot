Udai Mushab Snobar, 30, was killed on Sunday morning by Israeli occupation forces that invaded the village of Yatma, near Nablus.
A 30-year-old Palestinian man was killed on Sunday morning by Israeli occupation forces during confrontations in the village of Yatma, to the south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said that Udai Musbah Snobar, 30, sustained a live bullet wound to his face during confrontations with the Israeli occupation forces during a military raid into the village.

Snobar was transported in critical condition to a nearby hospital, but succumbed to his injuries.
Snobar is the latest Palestinian to fall victim to the ongoing Israeli military occupation of the occupied Palestinian territories and the unaccountable use of live ammunition by Israeli forces against defenseless civilians.
Five Palestinians were also killed in a military raid in the city of Jenin and its adjacent refugee camp on Sunday.
