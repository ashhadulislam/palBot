Israeli soldiers later turned over his body to the Palestinian Red Crescent.
According to eyewitnesses, the Israeli occupation forces chased the car where Sarahin was traveling with another person and shot heavily at it for no clear reason.
As the car reached the entrance to the refugee camp, Israeli soldiers, manning a military tower, opened fire at it, hitting Sarahi, who later died. 
The other person, whose identity and condition were not clear, was detained by Israeli occupation forces.
