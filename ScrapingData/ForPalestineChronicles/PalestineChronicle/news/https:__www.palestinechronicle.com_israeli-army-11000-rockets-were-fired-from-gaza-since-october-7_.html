On Monday morning, the Israeli army acknowledged the killing of three of its soldiers during the ongoing battles in the northern Gaza Strip, bringing the official death toll to 77 officers and soldiers since the beginning of the ground incursion.
Israel has evacuated nearly 70 percent of its forces from the northern Gaza Strip, according to a source in Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Palestinian Resistance movement Hamas, speaking to Al-Jazeera Arabic channel.
According to the source, the reason behind the Israeli decision to reduce the intensity of its military operations in the north is the steadfastness of Palestinian Resistance.
