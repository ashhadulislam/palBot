Asked by a user on X (formerly Twitter) to comment on the invitation, Musk replied that “(it) seems a bit dangerous there right now.” “But I do believe that a long-term prosperous Gaza is good for all sides,” he added.
Hamas’ invitation came after Musk paid a visit to Israel and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Musk also had a conversation with Netanyahu during which he agreed with the latter’s stance on Hamas, arguing that “those who are intent on murder must be neutralized.”
