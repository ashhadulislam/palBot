At 7 am sharp Gaza time, a four-day humanitarian truce kicked in. Until the last minute, however, Israel continued to kill Palestinians, from Khan Yunis to Nuseirat to the Indonesian Hospital.
Israeli occupation forces stormed the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza early on Friday morning, brutally shooting and killing a wounded woman in cold blood, shortly before a four-day humanitarian pause came into effect, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
WAFA correspondent said that, amidst intense gunfire, the Israeli occupation forces stormed the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, where they killed a severely injured woman, wounded three others and detained at least six people.

Medical sources described the Israeli atrocities in the Indonesian Hospital as heinous war crimes.
These actions may even surpass the severity of their previous actions at the Al-Shifa Medical Complex, which has been converted into a military camp by the Israeli occupation forces after forcibly evicting all of the patients and medical personnel.
Overnight, the hospital was directly bombed by Israeli occupation forces, leading to the tragic murder of workers, injuries to patients and displaced individuals, and the disruption of critical facilities, including surgery rooms and the oxygen station.
Palestinians bid farewell to their beloved ones, who were killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza soon before the ceasefire kicked in.

Earlier in the night, Israeli occupation forces shelled a residential building in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, igniting a fire and claiming innocent civilian lives, including children and women, and leaving others wounded.
Meanwhile, civil defense teams managed to pull ten civilians from under the rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit the Khader family home in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. 
WAR CHILDREN ORGANIZATION: The War Children organization said that a 4-day ceasefire is not enough for relief agencies to reach 1.1 million children in Gaza in urgent need of assistance.

A number of civilians, including children, were also brutally massacred in an Israeli airstrike which destroyed the Abu Shaweesh family home in Nuseirat refugee camp.
Israeli naval vessels also intensified their shelling off the coast of Khan Yunis and Rafah in southern Gaza, while Israeli warplanes continued their assaults on various areas in the Gaza Strip, resulting in dozens of civilian casualties.
