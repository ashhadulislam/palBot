Two Israeli military jeeps, a Wolf Armored Vehicle and a Defender, were reportedly finished off with machine guns at point-blank range.
Moreover, the statement reported that Al-Qassam fighters eliminated an Israeli unit sheltered inside a building in Beit Hanoun with 12 anti-fortification Al-Yassin TBG shells.
