Senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, highlighted the Resistance movement’s position regarding several issues on the 60th day of the war. 
In a press conference in Beirut, Lebanon, Hamdan stated that Israel’s many massacres against innocent civilians are indicative of its vindictive nature, and the reflection of its failure on the battlefield.
Below is a summary of Hamdan’s press statement. 
‘Nazi Massacres’ 
– The occupation’s horrific massacres against defenseless civilians reveal its retaliatory behavior due to the extent of (its) losses.
– The Nazi massacres are not limited only to Gaza, but also extended to the West Bank and Al-Quds.
– There are no safe areas in all of the Gaza Strip, despite American claims and the propaganda of the occupation.
The catastrophic situation of Palestinian hospitals in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, as Israel continues its relentless bombardment of the city.

No Negotiations Under Fire 
– Netanyahu has not been able to extract an image of a political or military victory for 60 days.
– No negotiations except with an end to the aggression against Gaza. We hold Netanyahu responsible for the lives of the detainees.
As expected, the Israeli military operation in Khan Yunis has turned out to be the most difficult as indicated by the latest reports from the battlefield.https://t.co/qxaqxcf0zE pic.twitter.com/hdt2AZX9ck

Obstruction of Aid 
– Anyone who obstructs the arrival of aid to Gaza is an accomplice in crime.
– We call on UNRWA and the World Health Organization to shoulder their responsibilities to continue providing assistance.
– UNRWA’s position is incomprehensible, and we call on humanitarian and medical organizations to intensify their entry into all areas of the Gaza Strip.
– We will not talk about the number of soldiers we have in custody, and the time has not yet come to talk about this topic.
