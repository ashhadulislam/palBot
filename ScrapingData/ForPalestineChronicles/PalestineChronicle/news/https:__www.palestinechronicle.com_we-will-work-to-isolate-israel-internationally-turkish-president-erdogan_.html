Erdogan vowed to isolate Israel internationally and have Israeli officials tried by international courts.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday pledged efforts to isolate Israel internationally over its military operation in the Gaza Strip.
“We will expand our diplomatic contacts. We will engage both with the 121 countries (who voted for the resolution on the Middle East) and the other 40 countries (who abstained from voting),” Erdogan said, addressing the Turkish parliament.

“We will continue to work toward isolating Israel internationally and support (Gaza) with all sorts of humanitarian assistance,” Erdogan continued.
“We will take steps to have (Israeli officials – PC)  tried by international courts,” he concluded.
Turkey has repeatedly expressed its willingness to act as a guarantor in putting an end to Israel’s war on besieged Gaza.
