Thousands of Cubans, led by President Miguel Díaz-Canel, marched on Thursday outside the US embassy in Havana in a show of solidarity with the Palestinian people and to demand an end to the Israeli aggression on Gaza, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
Wearing a black-and-white Palestinian keffiyeh, Díaz-Canel was accompanied by other Cuba’s officials, including Prime Minister Manuel Marrero and Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez.
The marchers walked for two kilometers, passing in front of the US Embassy. As they passed the embassy on the seaside avenue, some reportedly yelled “Fascist Yankees, you are terrorists.”

“Today we are supporting the Palestinian people, supporting all those people who feel the pain of having lost a family member, a loved one due to this massacre,” said Yanquiel Cardoso, as quoted by the Washington Post. 
“We are asking for a ceasefire… and for Palestine to be free.”
Many people waved posters with the phrase “Free Palestine” with photographs of children killed or injured by Israeli bombs or flags identifying both Cubans and Palestinians.
Others chanted “free, free Palestine, Israel is genocide” and “up with Palestinian freedom,” Reuters reported.

“This march means a lot to us,” said Sami Sabala, a 26-year-old Palestinian medical student in Havana. “It raises feelings … And it makes people feel that Palestine is not alone.”
This is the second time that Cuba’s top leaders have participated in solidarity rallies since the Israeli aggression began. Last week, the Palestinian flag was projected on the monument to José Martí, the most iconic in the Caribbean capital.
Cuba has been a longtime supporter of the Palestinian cause and hasn’t had diplomatic ties with Israel since 1973.
