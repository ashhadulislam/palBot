The bodies, whose burial or access had been prevented by Israel for more than 4 days, had decomposed in the hospital yard and had been mauled by stray dogs.
The bodies of 170 Palestinians were buried on Tuesday in a mass grave in the courtyard of the Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza City, due to the difficulty of burying them because of the siege imposed on it from all sides last Saturday.
WAFA correspondent reported that citizens, medical and administrative teams volunteered to dig a mass grave in the complex’s courtyard, and were able to bury 170 bodies of the Palestinians who died during Israel’s siege and bombing of the Shifa Complex.
