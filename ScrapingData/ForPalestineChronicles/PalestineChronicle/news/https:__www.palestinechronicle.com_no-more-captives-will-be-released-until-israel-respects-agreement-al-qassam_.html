The Al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement that no more Israeli captives will be released until Israel respects the ceasefire agreement. 
“The Al-Qassam Brigades have decided to delay the release of the second batch of prisoners until the occupation adheres to the terms of the agreement,” the statement, a copy of which was read by The Palestine Chronicle, read.

According to the statement, the terms that Israel violated are “related to allowing relief trucks into the northern part of the Gaza Strip, as well as the non-compliance with the agreed-upon criteria for the release of prisoners.”
Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari announced on Thursday that the truce in the Gaza Strip would begin on Friday, November 24, following an agreement between the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli government. 
According to the four-day truce deal, “three Palestinian prisoners, including women and children, will be released for every one Israeli prisoner”.

Moreover, “200 trucks of relief and medical supplies will be brought daily to all areas of the Gaza Strip,” according to the terms of the agreement. 
On Friday, the prisoner swap began in stages, with the release of 13 Israeli hostages and 39 Palestinian prisoners. 
According to Al-Jazeera, negotiations are still ongoing through mediators between the Palestinian Resistance and Israel regarding the second group of prisoners.
