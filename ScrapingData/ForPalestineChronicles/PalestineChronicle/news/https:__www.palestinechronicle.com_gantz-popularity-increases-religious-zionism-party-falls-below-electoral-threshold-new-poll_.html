The new poll confirms that Benny Gantz is more popular than Netanyahu and reveals a significant drop in support for far-right Religious Zionism.
A poll published by Israeli news outlet Maariv on Friday revealed the parties forming the current government – which obtained 64 seats in the November 2022 election – would now only obtain 41 seats.
Benny Gantz’s National Unity party has continued to rise in popularity. To the contrary, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party would win 18 seats, compared to the 32 it won in the latest election. 
52 percent of Israeli voters also think that Gantz is more suited to be prime minister, while only 27 percent think Netanyahu is the right man for the job.

The surprise in the poll, however, is the fall under the drop in support for the far-right Religious Zionism Party, which would fail to win the 3.25 percent vote threshold to enter the Knesset (parliament). 
The poll was conducted between November 15 and 16, so it does not reflect any potential change following the agreement between the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli government. 
A previous poll, conducted by the Lazar Institute on October 18-19, and commissioned by Maariv, revealed that 80 percent of Israelis believe that Netanyahu should take responsibility for the October 7 attack.

On October 7, Hamas launched the Al-Aqsa Flood operation, a surprise attack that included rocket launches and infiltrations into Israel, by land, sea, and air. 
The Israeli army launched a military aggression on the Gaza Strip, which killed nearly 15,000 Palestinians, including 6,150 children,  and injured nearly 36,000 more.
