The diplomat expressed his regret over the fact that “under pressure from Washington, the language of the resolution has been emasculated.”
Since the start of the war in Gaza, the United States has done its utmost to sabotage a balanced UN Security Council document on the issue, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzia said.
“From the very beginning of the current escalation in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict zone, the US delegation has sabotaged any attempt to develop a balanced and depoliticized document aimed at taking real and urgent measures to de-escalate the situation,” Nebenzia said.
Nebenzia told the UN Security Council after it adopted a resolution on the Middle East,
“Our American colleagues on the Council justified the collective punishment and annihilation of the Palestinians, first of all the civilian population, under the slogans about the fight against terrorism and Israel’s right to self-defense, effectively paralyzing the work of the main UN body for the maintenance of international peace and security.”
UN Res. Number 2712 called for “the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas and for urgent and extended humanitarian corridors throughout the enclave to save and protect civilian lives”.
12 UNSC members voted in favor of the resolution, while Russia, Britain and the US abstained.
Russia’s abstention was a result of Moscow’s frustration with the language of the resolution, which failed to demand immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Israeli war on Gaza.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel has, thus far, killed over 11,500 Palestinians, including 4,710 children and 3,160 women. The number of wounded has reached 29,800.
According to Nebenzia, Washington has consistently rejected draft resolutions demanding a humanitarian ceasefire.
The diplomat expressed his regret over the fact that “under pressure from Washington, the language of the resolution has been emasculated.”
“The Council does not even demand humanitarian pauses, but only calls for them, which is a mockery of the Council’s prerogative,” Nebenzia said.
