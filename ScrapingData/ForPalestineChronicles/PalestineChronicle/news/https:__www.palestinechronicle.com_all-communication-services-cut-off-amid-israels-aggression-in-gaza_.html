This is the fourth time communication services have been interrupted since the beginning of Israel’s war on Gaza on October 7.
The Palestinian Ministry of Communication in Gaza said that communication services, including fixed mainlines, mobiles, and internet were cut off in Gaza City and the northern Strip as a result of the ongoing Israeli aggression.
Executive Director of the Ministry’s Department of Communications, Laith Daraghmeh, called on international unions and bodies to respond to the warnings that were previously made to maintain the continuity of communication and internet services amid the difficult humanitarian conditions and the intensification of shelling by the Israeli occupation against the Strip.
Daraghmeh stressed that contact with international and UN organizations and sides is ongoing, but the occupation still insists on disregarding past interventions.

“The international community must ensure serious guarantees to not cut off communications again and to ensure universal access to communication and internet services to civilians, medical institutions, and journalists,” Daraghmeh said.
This is the fourth time communication services have been interrupted since the beginning of Israel’s war on Gaza on October 7.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes across various areas of Gaza since Friday morning, as Israel resumed its aggression after a seven-day truce, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said in a statement.
A four-day truce began on Friday, November 24, was extended twice, and ended on Friday, December 1, at 7 am local time today.
Since October 7, over 15,899 Palestinians, including over 6,200 children and more than 4,000 women were killed, with another 41,316 wounded, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.
